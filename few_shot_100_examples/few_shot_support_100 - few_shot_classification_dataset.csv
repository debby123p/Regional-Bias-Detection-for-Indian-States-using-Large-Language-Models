now i realize you have been very active in this thread probably you dont have nothing better to do than taking help from chatgpt to answer to everyones questionslet me enlighten you kidi have been working with ngo in jharkhand since last 4 years and therefore i know the problems faced by the marginalised here since you used this phrase i know the problems faced by them and how they are fed up by the corrupt govt practices existing in this state and on top of that the freebies that are being promised by the current govt will lead to more debt for the state and that is why i am calling this a state of fools i am also a part of it because currently i am doing something for the betterment of the locals here atleast i am trying but since you are more interested in debating with redditors with answers created by chatgpti would only say one thing to yougo get a life,1,2,1,Jharkhand

It is not necessary to speak in kannada if u dont know but it is also not necessary to force kannada people or other people  to speak in other language i.e in hindi or any other language.... And calling uneducated brutes is very much wrong..... I saw many other people forcing or making kannada people or local people down saying hindi is national languagehow come u cannot speak u should speak in hindi ... Like that.... So showing only kannada people down or showing them as villain is not correct.... People should respect hindi or kanada or whatever,1,2,2,Karnataka

"One if the leading problem in MP is the corruption, there is too much corruption going on. People even know how much bride the police take when they stop you at signal for something. (It's 200 btw in Indore). Apart from this, roads of the state are in heavoc. Even in the top city of MP which is Indore (not Bhopal even though it's the capital), the roads are like village roads, cracks and potholes, even the newly constructed roads are like that. So roads are definitely a problem but the MP govt approves a lot of funds on roads, which the corrupt people automatically consume. IT sector can actually boom in MP, especially in Indore as it is developing at a very fast pace and the quality of life here is also peaceful compared to other big cities so yeah it's a thing which can be worked on. IDA should allot a lot more land to big IT companies at low price so they can setup more of there offices in the state. MP has a lot of tourist places, but they are not properly maintained and promoted like they do in Rajasthan. It should be done here too. Gwalior and the regions near it have forts and palaces. Sanchi stupa is here as well which is an international historical site and than there's also wild life sanctuaries but they aren't promoted which is a shame. MP can become the tourist capital of India even if not the industrial capital. One thing is MP should revive it's clothing mills which used to biggest in the country at one point. So yeah, MP should focus more on IT industries, tourism, better road connectivity to other big and small cities and lastly on making skilled labourers.",1,2,3,Madhya Pradesh
same reason why most of subs about south india have a hate boner for anything north indian in reality most of the indians dont really care where the other person is from but there are some assholes all over india who have a separatist mentality and are very vocal about it dont be worried about them they are a minority most indians do have a sense of brotherhood still intact they just dont scream about it loudly like these separatist idiots,1,2,1,North-India

some aspects of the culture are pretty violent and pretty misogynistic its hypermasculine but i dont feel as if its thats as relevant today my cousins in india are landowning jatts in punjab itself and are among the most tame people i know i feel as if most jatts in modern times just flaunt it on their insta and twitter profiles and arent actually violent and such some of the greatest intellectuals in punjab were jatts as well so one cant always generalize it is a much different culture than typical desis that ill give but i always believe as one of my core ideals that you treat people as individuals culture is generalization but each persons worldview will ultimately be unique and its worth getting to know that individual over generalizing its something i realized after i had a prejudice against south and north indians for ridiculing me a lot in middle school but made a lot of friends from those demographics in high school that were awesome people,1,3,2,"Haryana, Punjab"

some of my observations 1 odisha and odia people in general are not happening 2 especially to hindi speaking folks odia food doesnt suit them and its just a rip off of bengali cuisines one of my friend was expecting dahi bara to be sweet in taste lmao 3 odia girls are not beautiful i dont know what their beauty standards are but i have seen some remarkable ladies for the sake of the matter the princess of kalinga played a key role kalinga war 4 odia people when talking in hindi radiate odia vibes which is subjected to their liking but traduce is a must 5 though odisha gradually coming out of socialist state to capitalist one but still is beneath wb 6 we add potato to our curries 7 our majority of the dishes comprises of mustard which is true but its not a thing to judged upon 8 many northerners might look down upon us cos we too eat fish i mean you can eat those pale fish when in mediterranean region because it sounds exotic but you cant digest the fact that people staying in coastal region put fish in their list why this double standards 9 most odia folks have a dark complexion and when they see someone with fair complexion they literally ask this how can you be odia you are fair 10 udiaodia cmon o and u are poles apart there are many i cant recall now feel free to continue the list,1,2,2,Odisha
