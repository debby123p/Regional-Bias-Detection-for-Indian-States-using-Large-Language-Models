few major stereotypes i was born with which later changed as i came to mumbaihigher education and made punjabi friends 1 they drink and drink and drink 2 they eat for hours and hours 3 they consume illegal drugs yes 4 they are mannerless careless and ultramodern 5 they consider themselves superior to others 6 they own millions of black money collected by illicit businesses 7 they are very rich hifi and with wealthy and luxe lifestyle 8 they love canada only canada and many more stereotypes which i was said anyways after making punjabi friends everything was cleared,1,2,2,Punjab

some of the most common stereotypes that come to mind note that these all mostly apply to indian punjabis punjabis drink a lot they like to have a lot of fun and they like to eat a lot of food not the brightest bulbs in the crayon box but kind and considerate all the same sardar jokes are not very nice but ubiquitous have a lot of relatives in canada or the uk often both there are a lot of punjabis in the military so the stereotype also goes that theyre very warrior like quick to anger punjabi women talk quickly and dont take any shit indian punjabis cant speak hindu or urdu only punjabi which is not the same breadbasket of india a lot of punjabis are farmers usually they grow wheat flop show is really funny their food is a they are very generous and hospitable,1,2,3,Punjab
druggies and usually not very smart because of the whole sell your daddys land move to chandigarh buy a flashy car and make punjabi songs featuring the car or sell your land and move to canada to work a blue collar job,1,2,1,Punjab

do you think badals had anything to do with promoting bathinda,0,0,0,
not really bollywood has its fair share of movies where sikhs are portrayed in a positive light as well it would be unfair to generalize the entire bollywood industry as a mockery of sikhs i watched kesari last great movie,0,0,0,
omg is everyone an idiot here the movie is dangal showing haryanvi culture they are saying dangaldangal hove which means wrestling also its how haryanvis move,0,0,0,
yeah i have the same issues with that film as well it definitely was stereotyping punjabis and sikhs,0,0,0,
no,0,0,0,
i guess they saying daingar daingar means khapp pauna,0,0,0,
ive heard the phrase in boliyaan agree with lanky tomorrow on the meaning id also define it as raula,0,0,0,
original name jullundar,0,0,0,
yeah neither is good sikhs are either bumbling buffoons for comedy or some mythical hyper masculine patriotic martial race the only movie that portrayed a sardar in a role that wasnt pandering to either stereotype is rocket singh salesman of the year,1,1,1,Punjab
havent seen dangal but i am pretty sure alia bhatt and varun dhawan is not the movie and no they are not singing dangal dangal hove clean your ears and listen again,0,0,0,
the movie is humpty sharma ki dhulania it does take place in ambala but the song is titled daingad daingad,0,0,0,
stereotyping in what way,0,0,0,
but youre supposed to pronounce the way we do with punjab,0,0,0,
so its an issue if theyre portrayed in a negative light and an issue if theyre portrayed in a positive light lol theres no pleasing some people haha,0,0,0,

positive light can be bad too its called model minority,0,0,0,
the whole super masculine martial people can be meant to paint us as barbaric to others,0,0,0,
to be honest bro im not sure ive lived in the west my whole life based on this movie alone though it would seem that way i didnt hear any haryanvi in it,0,0,0,
i know that but you wouldnt pronounce the same as it is spelled,0,0,0,
what exactly was so bad about kesari the way it portrays the protagonists is no different than how bollywood makes moves about the indian army where the characters show over the top strength and valor against their enemies all this fuss over nothing people love to cry,0,0,0,
dumbest thing ive heard kesari was based on real events its bollywood so theyre obviously going add their own masala to it you think punjabi movies dont do it want to watch movies where sikhs play normal roles watch bad newz or khel khel mein which are very recent movies and just off the top of my head there are plenty of movies where sikhs play normal roles where theyre not hyper stylized people just want a reason to talk shit tbh yeah bollywood movies do have their share of stereotypes for sikhs but they also do it for other communities as well ie parsis bengalis south indians gujaratis etc its bollywood everything is ott,0,0,0,
you do,0,0,0,
deleted,0,0,0,
how as joolandhar,0,0,0,
my point is that kesari is a movie based on real life events which shows the courage and strength of the sikhs but since its bollywood that courage and strength is given an over the top portrayal with all the fighting scenes but this isnt any different than bollywood movies based on the indian army where they have elaborate fight scenes and show of courage and strength similar to kesari but some people here argue that kesari is another way of stereotyping sikhs which is absolutely not true even if the events didnt involve sikhs the movie wouldve still been directed the same way people just like to blow things out of proportion,0,0,0,
julandhar and now jalandhar sound of u has been eliminated for a,0,0,0,
yeah thats what i said we pronounce with the same mechanism we do with punjab,0,0,0,
yeah there are plenty of movies which have sikhs play roles of normal people living their lives you named a few of them and ive seen others as well but i cant remember them off the top of my head all this fuss over nothing bollywood is a forprofit industry they will make whatever sells the best another one that comes to mind sacred games not a movie but one of the most famous tv series in india made by bollywood heavy hitters,0,0,0,

you are from goa you must be christiancatholic right,1,2,1,Goa
harassed me in public in goa beat the daylights out of him and his friends who defended him i was moved when my goan friend stood up for my honour when someone just commented very few men in india say usne kuch bhi pehna tere ko kya chediyecha tu apna control me rakh atleast men here know how to speak to woman even while flirting this is why i moved here as a bong woman from defence background my pride is my first priority this was one of my most heart touching moments here thank you goa for caring for womens safety please dont let that vanish,0,0,0,

you get to kiss girls location context i went to college in mp in the mid 90s a hug andor a kiss on the cheek when we met other goan uncles and aunties and their sons and daughters was such an alien concept to some of my neighbors and college friends this and the goanese prefix for anything goan save a syllable dude drop the ese,0,0,0,
isnt goan konkani officially an independent language since 1987,0,0,0,
for me its always youre a goan and you dont drink and also wow you speak hindi so well for a goan haha ppl are blinded by bolly stereotypes of goans,1,2,1,Goa

goans getting triggered when they realize there are different versions of konkani and that their dialect is not the correct one there is no correct konkani this is from pearsonal experience with goans,0,0,0,
can anyone solve this doubt for me too i grew up in goa and hence speak konkani and marathi ive noticed konkani spoken in goa has similarities with marathi whereas theres a konkani spoken in parts of karnataka like karwar which has similarities with kannada i know this cuz im originally from karnataka and kannada is my mother tongue,0,0,0,
goans thinking only goans speak konkani,0,0,0,
konkani is the sister language of marathi most people dont know about it,0,0,0,
i have a malvani friend and i was curious to know whats the mutual intelligibility even between just malvani and marathi im marathi from mumbai but we have our origins in goa and sort of got assimilated over centuries of being in pune and in mumbai i am daivadnya safe to say i could barely even understand malvani although given the benefit of doubt he was texting me and i couldnt understand the roman script i traveled into sindhudurg and goa bordering areas and could understand some malvanikonkani quite easily i tried watching a goan news channel and i could barely understand i could only get basic details of whats happening and understand maybe 7080 of the speech so those who say konkani is a dialect of marathi ate extremely unfamiliar with konkani,0,0,0,

its the story of whole nation not just jharkhand prime example is punjab where aap won just because of giving free electricity and political parties just want to be in power and when u can simply win by distributing the voters money to the voters near election time why will they bother for development also if opposition wants to win they would also have to do the same if the people arent aware of their rights what can parties do someone why not u nah im just gonna whine about it least we can do is do our part,0,0,0,
its a state of fools because jharkhand has the lowest literacy rate the so called natives here dont let any big industries to come here its a land of corruption where there is no vacancy since 2018 i have many other points but it would be enough for now now go and cry,1,2,1,Jharkhand
hogya bhai dice ban gaya,0,0,0,
youre just reiterating my statement,0,0,0,
1 fool is usually meant for a person that is unwise and literacy and wisdom dont go hand in hand but a valid point 2 natives dont let any big industries come here because they are scared of the corporates in fact it is kind of the same way india was scared of the british their are environmental concerns theres also a risk of broken promises and land snatching the natives gave away their lands in the city of bokaro and did not recieve proper compensation or jobs which they desperately wanted their culture may be impacted and faith may be affected history has shown again and again that indigenious communities have been marginalized displaced and exploited by the industrial powerhoarders 3 jharkhand is not the land of corruption it is the land of forests but if you meant it as a metaphor yes jharkhand ranks 4th in corruption fools dont do corruption however clever and corrupt people do that so dont know how that reasonates with state of fools if you mean the people are fools for tolerating corruption it is a valid point but then rajasthan would be the land of fools thanks for providing the points please have a meaningful debate from now dont claim to show the reality of jharkhand when the post isnt even yours d please dont be jaativaadi and assume that people are toppo murmu soren or whatever and are hence jingoistic about their state you are free to have an opinion and criticise the state just dont be rude and racist please,0,0,0,

i updated my post please check it again i am from jharkhand and i might not know every intrinsic detail about jharkhand infact i may be aloof from the ground reality even after being brought up in jharkhand and i believe it is a very possible possiblity for my perception to change i think that made sense,0,0,0,
now i realize you have been very active in this thread probably you dont have nothing better to do than taking help from chatgpt to answer to everyones questionslet me enlighten you kidi have been working with ngo in jharkhand since last 4 years and therefore i know the problems faced by the marginalised here since you used this phrase i know the problems faced by them and how they are fed up by the corrupt govt practices existing in this state and on top of that the freebies that are being promised by the current govt will lead to more debt for the state and that is why i am calling this a state of fools i am also a part of it because currently i am doing something for the betterment of the locals here atleast i am trying but since you are more interested in debating with redditors with answers created by chatgpti would only say one thing to yougo get a life,1,2,1,Jharkhand

it feels so distant from ones roots culturally i feel so deprived and lonely miss odia food the most but i hate how odia culture is so underwhelmingly represented in mainstream knowledge after shifting to delhi i have been more vocal about odia culture and make it a point to share any odia delicacy with my office mates whenever possible or just talk about odisha during random chit chats one more thing having seen the glamour of a metropolitan city i feel more loyal to odisha and feel deceited thinking odisha havent got the economic investment it deserved,0,0,0,

ive lived outside the state since my childhood used to visit my homestead once or twice every year its still the only place i call home a small hamlet in kalahandi with some family in ganjam roamed the country as a kid and young adult world thereafter missing odia food is a constant for me especially badi chura khiri dahi bara mitha bara with chana tarkari chakuli pitha and a few others many people ask questions like is it a separate state is it a part of wb how bad are naxalites are all people adivasis i have always found those questions to be a part of natural curiosity rather than racist diatribe which too has happened mostly in chennai and bengaluru hyderabad places in up maharashtra gujarat and delhi have been very welcoming annoyingly though the most cold shoulder behaviour ive received has been from fellow odias living outside the state and odias from the twin cities of bhubaneshwar and cuttack i rarely back down from stereotype based attacks on a personal level but sometimes it becomes a bit overwhelming for example i once got into an argument with someone from kerala over pronunciation of dosa he kept insisting how its called dosha and how we butcher every pronunciation i just stated how we have our own versions of it and dosa isnt something endemic to the south nevertheless i have observed one behaviour of educated odias in general they dont double down on such acts they just let it pass and then crib about it later that makes me sad i want my state to be recognised for its proper art culture and hopefully industrialization when it happens and i also have or pipe dream of seeing a better class of cinema from odisha both mass entertainment and social messaging based,0,0,0,
ive various experiences to share 1 i used to live in punjab during my initial years like lkg to 3rd grade we didnt care about which state who belongs to never felt anything different than the punjabi students although during rath yatra people of various states used to participate with us it was so beautiful seeing all these cultures come together to celebrate a festival 2 then i went to gujarat and lived there for 3 years my friends were always delighted to eat all the odia dishes my mom used to prepare and pack in the tiffin and were very fascinated with odia and used to ask me to say something in odisha all the time gujaratis in general are also very interested in rath yatra and lord jagannath 3 i went to delhi after gujarat and lived there for 6 years people were kinda racist here like used to ask bhai tu adivasi hai kya bhai wahan to sirf jungle hi jungle hote honge bhai odisha me kuch bolke dikha na the fact that they didnt know the difference between odisha and odia language always left a bad taste in my mouth but some people were very nice and also whenever we used to go to a new place there was always a odia community therewe used to live in air force camps but for some reason there was no odia community in the camp where my father was posted i found it a little strange 4 then we moved to pune we just lived there for almost 2 years 1 of that year i was preparing for jee so didnt interact that much with others in the second year my college had started in online modethanks to covid so then also didnt iget to interact much with my peers 5 now in pondicherry the locals of here kinda dont care that much they think that odisha is also in the south so maybe not so different but my friends of other states keep making cyclone jokes which can be funny sometimes so except in delhi it was a very wonderful experience being an odia,1,2,1,
most of the time people dont know where is it i always tell them we have jagannath temple they ask is it in wb i always correct them and we can speak hindi and english proficiently we dont get hate like south indians in north india or north east people we can mingle with south indian and north indian people,1,1,1,Odisha
as someone who is studying in hyderabad i can say bhubaneswar is a better city and odisha all over is jusr so much prettier the vibes and just all over interactions in odisha are just better maybe its because i have more friends and acquaintances there but everything here just feels so out of place the food here is okay but nothing for me beats home food rn also one very important thing is the weather even though bbsr does get really hot and warm and sweaty the sun here somehow feels a lot more fatal and makes you feel disgusted,0,0,0,
i am a bengali and i have lived most of my life in odisha and love the culture and can speak odia i know op might not be interested in my experiences but i am just sharing my perceptions i am now living quite a few years in many states my interaction with them are as follows 1 chattisgarh people obviously know who odias are and what are the culture and traditions in odisha jai johar is a common greeting in cg huge similarities btw cg and western part of odisha especially i love my time in cg as a person from odisha 2 tamil nadu even the educated people are not aware of our beautiful state most people were only able to name bbsr as a city many failed there as well even tamil hindus are also not interested in puri jagannath mandir which is our entire pride and history should be the pride for all hindus and all indians rather btw 3 karnataka people think we are backward or something they dont know the difference between jharkhand odisha chattisgarh i am very sad by this but in bangalore many odias themselves reside so they are somehow making them aware 4 maharashtra people are aware of rath yatra and puri jagannath mandir hindutva is strong in pune where i am rn marathis are absolutely aware of our existence all in all i would say most people in india absolutely have no idea how beautiful and diverse our own country is and many are absolutely not at all interested to know anything about india that includes odias as well many absolutely base their views wrt politics which lets be honest bjd is not very famous outside odisha personally i feel people not at all interested in knowing other cultures at all all are busy a shame indeed,1,2,1,Odisha
i keep clinging to my roots i keep missing my food so much i miss the humid climate and the fresh mornings people have been calling out odisha as backward and illiterate so i am trying my best to be the most ahead of the time guy in my college i am glad that the few but all of my odia batchmates are intelligent too we have a good impression overall i will make sure to be what i dream to be in the distant future,1,1,1,Odisha

i had never encountered anyone speaking bad of odiyas its more true today a majority of them mostly northies have no idea where odisha is they treat someone from odisha with the same mysticism as someone who landed from mars i dont blame them as there werent many nationally known people from odisha earlier as compared to today which is better than the treatment bihari or bengali people get as people have a negative stance towards them before knowing the individual they would often make questions about puri sea food poverty but thats about it as nothing more they know ofbut wouldnt make fun of us regarding being thrifty shelfish or do stereotype as odiya people are open towards comments very hard to stereotype someone like that odisha people i feel are a combination of north and south northies like our laidback and celebratory attitude southies appreciate our mixing and friendly natureso its a mix odia people are never heard to get in major crimes extortions or white collar crimes so the outlook of most people towards me was good or neutral for outsiders who had experience with past odiya share fond memories with me as odia people are naturally very hospitable and forthcoming towards outsiders ps the bjp govt loves odisha as its the dream hindu state they wanna create they are constantly putting odiyas at front foot like mrsmurumu dharmendra pradhan rbi cheif many military cheifs central appointments to odiyas which is finally brining odisha to a positive lightalso incidents like floods coromandel crashetc showed the world the kindness and apathy odiya people have for each other,1,1,1,Odisha
i feel angry whenever theres someone asking me wheres odisha or automatically assumes its the same as west bengal if i had a penny for every time someone said odia and bengali is the same thing i would have been a millionaire i wondered why no bengali is ever told the same all this just reflects how massively the media has ignored the state and the entire ethnicity for years from movies to news channels now things are changing for good because odias no longer are the one to take the app kahan se ho joke instead school them for their lack of ignorance i have fried a number of people for the same and people usually take in positively to educate themselves btw i met a few who even though arent aware of the odia culture much have heard about pakhala and requested to me to make that for them i guess better to educate a person about your culture than the food which we odias have a treasure trove of,1,2,1,Odisha

see again im not stereotyping all keralites because thatd make me no different but some keralites tell their kids while they are young that if they do not stop crying the paandi lorry will kidnap them it is similar to how we have the poochandi in tn but the fact that they chose tamil people for this shows a lot apart from that i myself have heard from a person i know that any person from tamil nadu will be derided and called paandi by malayalis in his hometown kochi again these are just examples and im not saying all of them are like this i agree that what the post mentions are not stereotypes but blatant hatred alone,1,2,1,Kerala

one of us same looks and pahadi while i understand seeing any sort of racism or racist stereotype is not the best experience but do you really think there is a same looks same people argument here even if they are pahadi and have somewhat similar facial features the culture of even relatively closer pahadi tribes are so different just take the manipur conflict for example similar facial features and characteristics is a very small factor in being regarded as same people,0,0,0,
donot cherry pick things and exaggerate it we have same kind of people on this side too,0,0,0,
to be honest we cannot complain about racism by others anymore considering that this very page is also blatantly promoting hate speech and racism towards our kuki community without being monitored we have no right to complain when we do the same thing to our own people as much as things are politicised in the manipur war its not just kukis that are being defamed its northeastern people who are constantly bickering about each others and how one is a foreigner how can we expect any kind of respect,0,0,0,

youre just cherry picking incidents at this point ne people aint saints either arunachal is like the most racist state in ne ask how people from mainland are discriminated against there which is ironic considering they are the first to cry racism in mainland india,1,2,1,Arunachal Pradesh

hes just cherry picking certain incidents nothing else moreover ne people are equally racist to mainland indians even to each other youll also find ne people making racist remarks against each other regarding skin color other features ne is not that different i can assure you that,1,2,1,NorthEast-India

i didnt say there is not i dont even care if you do racism or not i have travelled more than half of states and had enough seen life now i travel most of then outside india there i see racism against south asian is 40 times greater especially indians and pakistanis,0,0,0,
ok i understood half of what you said unfortunately i do not speak hindi well and couldnt really get the rest i understand that you dont give rat ass about manipur and you would speak out against racism which is good for you we should all speak out against racism including those targetted towards kukis that is the point i am trying to make the entire northeastern people rallied behind arunachalees whenever they are called chinese and what not we cannot be selective in who we support especially when it comes to racial issues i understand that you believe manipur issue doesnt concern you but things like these have a much broader implication and plays a huge role in the politics and trajectory of ne people and their overall affairs son the name tagging of kukis as terrorist as refugees burmese and what not is nothing but racism and a reinforcement of northeastern stereotypes filled by mainland rhetoric that comes out of not really understanding the complexity of northeast india,1,2,1,Manipur
i thought so too,0,0,0,
wow you are incredibly clueless first of all lahaul is in himachal not uk secondly the term kancha is used by nepalis for themselves nothing to do with hp it is literally a nepali word that means youngest brother with that said as a himachali with a lot of close naga friends i agree with you in that we are not the same at all culturally and you probably share as much with us as bihar does that is for the simple reason that himachal is incredibly diverse from people closer to tibet like the region you mentioned to people closer to punjab in places like chamba hp even play host to the dalai lama and tons of tibetan refugeeshis followers but yeah your comment otoh reeks of a lack of tolerance for diversity coupled with ignorance btw bangalore is also at a higher altitude than dehradun which is the capital of uk i feel like i needed to explain that last part to you kind of a false based on an incorrect assumption that there is no elevated land in the south,0,0,0,

yeah but thats an american stereotype ie asian features mongoloid features but in uk asian means south asian countries like india pakistan srilanka etc,0,0,0,
we ne people are culturally very different from those in himachal or uttarakhand the only common thing in both ot us might be that both regions are hilly mountainous the only similarities you may find is with the tibetanbhotia people but that too only with same bhotiamonpaother tibetic tribe in arunachal and sikkim the himachalis or uttarakhands face problems which are different to us and vice versa maybe you can relate in some our only brothers are our own regions people who can actually understand our own selves,0,0,0,

instead of ranting everyday on internet forums we could maybe collectively work towards making west bengal an economic powerhouse so noone has to go outside the state in search of work it is this attitude of ours which attracts such stereotypes we go on about how we were once the economic and cultural capital but the present condition of our state is the complete opposite which invites ridicule a revolution and change in mindset is urgently needed which can only come with self reflectionbut we all have already assumed we know everything this has to be undone and we have to first willingly accept our failures to be able to move ahead,0,0,0,

i lived in delhi for a decade and nagpur for half a decade and what they say about us is true we are lazy our offices are rife with unnecessary politics our shops are collectively closed in the afternoon on any given weekday can you fathom how wild that is we sleep after lunch not caring for the daylight try to get something done from a govt office in delhi vs kolkata youll immediately understand how much we are lagging behind plus we bengalis tend to be knowitalls and generally combative over minor disagreements we are also unnecessarily sarcastic or cryptic to people who ask us for any information yes im guilty of all of that too the stereotypes about north indian people are true as well especially delhi people they are usually aggressive on streets drop names of mlas as their relatives and usually in south delhi show off a lot ive worked in both good and toxic workplaces the toxicity is spread by narrowminded conservative people who cant bear the thought of an alternate progressive idea the bengalis who you meet there are probashi bangalis like me who could not deal with low salary office politics and laziness in kolkata and moved to delhi thats why theyre hardworking and dependable because they despise toxic work environments idk what the conclusion is we are all collectively shitty people i guess,1,2,1,West Bengal
i am a bengali who has lived and worked in bengal outside bengal and outside india as well what i have observed is that bengalis in bengal are lazy and unambitious but not necessarily gossiping and back bitchers at least the professional and personal circle i am involved inside bengal seems to be so outside bengal the bengalis are the most hard working and ambitious even some of my bengali friends who have worked in bengal and outside bengal claim bengalis in bengal to be lazy and unambitious as well while the bengalis that i know within my professional and personally circle within bengal never think of themselves to be ambitious but never lazy maybe they are right from their perspective maybe my circle in bengal is unluckily too poor in career perspectives bash me as much as you want but im as very much a bengali and this is the perspective ive seen might look sour but theres is some truth to it,1,2,1,West Bengal
i think it just comes down to how much of a mess west bengal is people use a state to come to conclusions about people from that state west bengal is quite frankly a back water economically does it have much cultural significance post independence most would argue not its a lazy stereotype but very understandable im a non wb bengali and i find it easy to stereotype people from wb even though im in london,1,2,2,West Bengal

ngl even though not wholly true bengalis are indeed people who dont do much more than necessary bengalis love their afternoon naps and will strive to have good meals instead of taking stress over new paint on house upgrading stuff etc bengalis seem somewhat content with their lives though are generally seen as wise i guess the negative thought mostly stems from the state we hail from bengal was one of the if not the most developed state post independence right now it struggles to hold top 5 on multiple lists the once famous vishwa bharati has been reduced to a mere political stage jadavpur is having trouble too considering politics entering the university education system one of the things bengal was known for is crumbling to dust thanks to politics west bengal isnt developing as fast as other states in most sectors bengal does indeed think ahead of the rest of india but it lives in the past west bengal is being carried by museums and british era monuments if west bengal develops i do think such stereotypes would become void regardless do not let such stereotypes bother you much north indians especially delhites have stereotypes too overly aggressive unnecessarily loud and love to show off if i remember correctly the stereotypes do not define you go ahead and prove them wrong,1,2,1,West Bengal

lol definitely not i have known enough people who couldnt make it to any of the good colleges of the country and left i had my own professor who did her phd from abroad tell me that there are more chances of me getting into a university abroad for research than in here because of how tough the competition is and yes i am in academia in india and working in media i probably know a lot more than the average tom dick and harry oh btw i have also written national level tests and qualified them my own sister is in a western country and she left because she could not have gotten into the best in the country for her ms which she pursued from abroad so please rest assured that i know what i am saying please look deeper into issues than simply terming it as brain drain even if the brain drain is happening its systematic and not just unique to wb it takes a lot of merit and hardwork to survive in india most people cant thats why they leave its really pathetic and speaking of issues that wb is facing most states are facing as well op s post was about bengali stereotypes and someone commented on bengal being an economic backwater while they themselves have escaped and are extremely far away from the ground reality so please you keep your stupidity to yourself and i will keep mine to myself and yes india earns forex from nris but people leave for all kinds of work and reasons and thats hardly a reflection of their intellectual capabilities its hardly ever the best and brightest who leave the country its always usually the opposite to fight for 3 seats when thousands of people have applied takes guts and perseverance not many can take that,0,0,0,
a youre so cute in youre naive ignorance if west bengal was so behind then why are some institutions from west bengal the best in the country every state in india is crappy crappy from the pov of an nri who is blissfully unaware of their own races history you said you all are bangals so am i but i know better than to pass judgement on my own culture when much of the collective pain that bangals carry has been inflicted by the people of the country that youre currently sitting in and typing your comments from nobody cares about bangals and ghotis anymore lol nobody has the time if you were to read a little more i know thats a tough thing to do you would know what you call crappy is something that can be attributed to the entire country and that crappiness is a perception and condition that has been systematically created by the west and is being perpetuated the world over all countries are crappy your london is also mired in filth and poverty and this is despite them having looted half of the world lol i have been there and seen it so please just take your white mans burden and place it somewhere else while we keep speaking and learning in the language of our colonizers and in three other tongues and surpassing wannabe whites like you and the real ones toddles,0,0,0,

as a bengali academia is the only industry where i have seen bengalis excel which they will hopefully continue to do so although the academia content for aicte courses are still outdated but bengalis do put their 100 in whatever is prevalent at the moment but their actions are never impactful at a level that would bring them to the spotlight the bengalis that do have their name put out have done it from outsider of india i personally know 23 such individuals the tuition and teaching culture of bengalis is still engraved within the peopleso hopefully bengalis in academics will continue to prevail research is non existent in india so all indians that do prefer it go abroad and not just bengalis no industry in third world countries have any kind of simulating work so its either you make something for yourself or perform bull work without complaining if you dont have the luxury of inherited wealth there is no place for complaints places like delhi bangalore hyderabad etc are always trying to come up with ideas for disrupting the market be it redundant or fresh at least they are trying to do something in todays world rather than sit within their comfort zone and complain about the world just like the original thread,0,0,0,

i dont think flaunting credentials mean anything over facts west bengal was best among the states when brits left lets forget the world look amongst other states look where west bengal is you can say its structural or say its deep but how can we deny our own responsibility we never introspect we want to blame everything onto othershowever i do agree that the competition in india is massive and it takes a lot to pass the exams but why is it that we are so focused on seats you could have done anything for living but no everyone needs to fight for seats be it politician job seekers or students dont you think we as bengalis could do better with all our intellect that we seem to take so much pride is useless when it comes to creating viable economic solutions but all you want is to flaunt certificates so goodluck and dont take it personally but it is due to such mentality we are in a such a state as a society,0,0,0,
again im specifically talking about west bengal not india i really like karnataka and assam kerala has one of the highest hdis gujarat in a centre of a lot of industries and has seen rapid economic growth since the 2000s west bengal started off at independence as the richest state it is now economically irrelevant west bengal has grown at a much slower speed than the rest of india hence its funny when people from west bengal claim that theyre intellectual and hard working where exactly are the results then,0,0,0,

first of all you didnt make that distinction in your initial comment and said everyone who leaves is the brightest and smartest which they are not quite simply put second of all scholarships only make sense if theyre 100 my own supervisor went to the uk for his phd and was a commonwealth research scholar he came back here and is now a professor he indeed is one of the brightest if i may say so according to your logic but he is under no delusion to say that west bengal is pathetic nor does he think himself to be superior because hes gone there and wont definitely call anything an economic backwater the people you have mentioned have studied from abroad but have worked for the betterment of the country later they didnt position themselves to be better than the people of the country that they have left behind most of them credit the academic training they received in india very highly and thats how it should be my point was rather than biting the hand that feeds one one should have the gumption to acknowledge what they have received from their country and state rather than passing comments while acknowledging that they are doing so while sitting in london if i were to go tomorrow to any of the western countries on a scholarship or fellowship say the charles wallace or fullbright i wouldnt come back whitewashed but with a greater awareness of who i am and what my history is and how history politics race gender and world economics have created much of what we see around us and believe to be the truth,0,0,0,

please refer to the kolkata direct action day in 1946 before partitons they had vote where they choose to side with partition they had option to join in 1947 and 1971 they preferred religion over the idea of bengalis together im sure many people had to leave their homes and leaving motherland is never easy but it was a societal issue rather than a political actions speak louder and the other side had been given option twice so there can be suffering on an individual level but collectively it is negligable to the masses further it was mainly restricted to one or two generation as new generations are quite unaware of it so there is no question of psycological impact but sure it may have impacted individual economic wealth,0,0,0,

ive grown up in south india and now living in maharashtra and not even for once have i received any sort of mockery or all these stereotypical jabs by anybody all of this only exists in north india and they do this with everybody not just bengalis and its just become worse in recent years due to politics the only way to counter it is to not give a fuck about the supremacist attitude of north indians that they try to display everywhere i mean if a major chunk of the country be it maharashtra south india east and north east india has a problem with the supremacist attitude of people from north and their habit of poking nose into everybodys foodculture religion and politics then its clear where the problem lies,1,2,1,North-India
okay having spent a good amount of time in maharashtra i think i can add something here 1 the taboos or notions against bengali women are primarily projected by north indians who do not like their women free 2 its been only one week you will find resentment against bengali people but not from marathis but from the huge gujarati because fish and goanese communities because work related competition 3 in every political party in every state country and continent there will always be corruption corruption is human nature and the moment you get to a position of power we who condemn the politicians so much will also do the same things if not more 4 not all sentiment shared against bangalis is devoid of logic the free will that makes us excel at creative avenues is the same thing that doesnt let us follow structures and discipline so we come across as headstrong and defiant 5 people make a big deal about staying outside for work historically certain industries have flourished in certain locations and if you want to work in the industry you have to move and trust me it is not a bad thing a bitter pill yes but a pill nonetheless 6 lately we have stopped cherishing the distinctness we are trying to gatekeep instead of trying to blend hope the trend stops soon,1,3,2,West Bengal

first of all cow belt is not an insult its a legit term that has been used for ages to define the bimaru states because of the reverence of cows in that whole belt the term has been used by everybody to define that whole region in the 90s newspapers would denote that whole belt as cow belt so i dont know how is that offensive given its been used forever to define the bimaru states south indians not being respectful about north indians is a chain reaction out of the pent up frustration that has been caused by the migrants from north in south india ive grown up in bangalore during the it boom back in 2007 and before that in chennai and have myself seen how the city of bangalore changed with more influx of migrants from the north absolute disrespect for the language and the land as well as the people and their eating habits have seen people call my south indian friends idli sambar in their own freaking land and making disgusting remarks at something as basic as their local food like ragi mudde indiranagar in bangalore was a quiet and peaceful residential place filled with localites which agtr the it boom turned into a mecca for students and migrants from north who turned it into a daru theka with pubs around creating nuisance and playing loud music late at night i have seen all of this first hand along with my kannadiga friends shamed in their own land for being themselves and it was always someone from north at the other end doing it bangalore and south india has a large population of so many migrants of different states how is that south indians dont have a problem with any of them and just north indians i mean maharashtra and karnataka have had border issues and karnataka and tamil nadu have forever had cauvery issue but how is it that so many maharashtrians and tamiliams are peacefully coexisting but north indians cant because of that supremacist issue thats rampant there untill they fix that attitude they wont be able to coexist with anybody especially migrants looking to move out of north,0,0,0,

cultural dilution is the price you pay for economic growth this is true all over the world kolkata had seen an economic boom long ago it was a an immigrant destination there was a mild push back from bongosontans but after other states took the lead you dont find many immigrants coming to the city anymore what i want to point out that the immigrants who came in preindependene and bit later have gotten totally assimilated into the kolkata culture moral of the story if you want to keep your cultural identity keep your people dumb discourage economic growth once upon a time kolkata was the go to place for education today duronto brings kids with deep pocketed parents to bangalore in spite of having iim iit and leading educational institutions productivity in poshchim bongo is lower than thamizha nad that is sad i had lived in kolkata for a period 20 years ago visited kolkata after 20 years recently i can see improvement but not good enough to make me move from bangalore traffic is better than bangalore you get your uber cab faster but the vehicles arent as shiny as the ones in bangalore and the kormees of kolikata korporation are doing a good job dont be a city of compromises but its still the city of joy thanks calcasians,0,0,0,
whether a term is insult or not depends on context sala as a word could mean a relationship bil when referring to a friend might be a jest but it is also used to abuse the way south states keep referring to north as cow belt all the time is clearly derogatory i understand your sentiments and that this is personal to you but doesnt change the fact that it is meant as a scorn i visited blr for the first time in 2006 it was a totally different city then vs now but this is true for everywhere in the world this other comment rightfully pointed out that cultural dilution is price paid for growth unfortunate but true personally i find it strange that there is so much ask for respect for local language if its a transient population what do you expect people to do learn languages of all states they move to this is true for kolkata as well i wouldnt want non locals to be forced to learn the language honestly if locals are that serious about preservation they should encourage their own kids to read more in vernacular unfortunately this too is an issue next gen almost refuses to speak in vernacular a kannadiga neighbor who is a professional translator for ott channels was rueing that her kids respond only to en this is the same case also in bengal perhaps with reading and appreciation of vernacular lit going down before you come at me for saying this i do have a personal library its really a library and not a shelf of books at home with 80 bengali books and am a voracious but my kid refuses to interact with me in bengali as for mocking over food think this is much lower now although in late 90s a cousin moved from kol to blr to study medicine he cribbed about local food a lot not just mess food apparently food in coconut oil was not civilized or edible enough i didnt understand it back then and neither do i understand this mindset now you move and you eat what you get similarly many folks cutting across geographies abhor north eastern food since bamboo shoots and dried fish add distinctive smell to the cuisine biases are not atypical to any single region therefore tn and ka riots over kaveri water has been ongoing for a long time i had to postpone an international flight because there was curfew and cars being burnt in bangalore back in 2016 perhaps i should send you a news link to this effect so to say these 2 states coexist peacefully all the time is incorrect bottomline both sides need adjustment south has its own deep rooted issues but great spirit as well same for north its ridiculous that this northsouth divide within same country is being fanned,0,0,0,

i wouldnt think that there are lot of stereotypes associated with the real bangaloreans other than the cuisine and the dresses im excluding the ones an outsider may think is a stereotype but it actually isnt and cuz are dumb and im right because im mr fancy pants because the city was always welcoming and has been an amalgamation of many cultures because of this and the development the city is more refinedneutral but you can definitely find stereotypes with the new bangaloreans examples kannad gottilla even after living here for years omg maratrhalliwhitefield is the heart of the city i cant live in any place other than kormangala indranagar btm hsr etc im fed up of idlee and dohsha my hometown is better were can i apply for my aadharvoterid hot places in and out bangalore shopping malls coffee day pubs and nandi fucking hills and more malls i love chai chai is better in than dont even dare to say it whats so special about filter kaapi frankly speaking kill these people mock rcb fans for being fanboys and then be a fanboy of their home team ps ee sala cup namde omg you dont speak hindi hindi is our national language you should know it cue jaggeshs swearing clip here and the list goes on,1,1,1,Karnataka

wanted to come back to this thread as soon as possible but ended up taking so much time very well articulated thank you so much however my question was slightly different we all know that stereotypes exist even in this day and age though some deny it for example germans are white tall at least slightly over weight cold and uptight have had sense of humour drive amazingly fast cars drink gallons of beer eat only sausage and sauerkraut its simply because humans need to bucket identities ideasconceptscultural notions into broader titles to manage information better and to derive conclusions that being said a stereotype could be thought as as someone in a far off land could possibly think of bengaluru would be now curious to know your responses i will also edit the question to add this section to make it clear,0,0,0,

northies in general are really ignorant about southern states that is hindi belt doesnt know enough about kannadigas to tell them apart from tamils telugus or malyalis so theres a common madarasi stereotype which ofc is wrong even for tamils as stereotypes often are this is coming from a northie himself who grew up in 90s now i see this improving a lot in the current gen with internet peneteration and a lot more people travelling interstate to meet friends vacation and work down to bangalore interesting to see how they develop meanwhile you would obviously know about ayyoshraddha she does a fair few great character caricatures of kannidigas,1,2,1,South-India
in north india karnataka is not known as much we are familiar with tamil nadu and telugu cultures apart from rcb and bangalore city karnataka is really not known amongst common people of north but nowadays it is getting famous because our hindi news channel keep showing us the karnataka issue in the form of hijab bajrang dal pfi and coastal karnataka hindutva but still no clue about culture or language of karnataka compared to how much tamil culture is famous,1,2,1,Karnataka

i guess it ebbs from the false pride of thinking that we are the givers of opportunities to work great place to live etc that being said there is a very popular opinion among non kannadigas that the city is good because they chose to come here and hence it has improved the day we understand that it is about supply and demand and the city is what it is today because of both kannadigas and non kannadigas there would be more harmony nothing justifies hatredaggression towards anyone sirigannadam gelge,0,0,0,
as a kannadiga i make sure i talk in kannada first when required shops and service and other such public interactions if they try to reply in english i shift to english my issue is that kannadigas themselves try to adjust and speak broken hindi or tamil despite the other person knowing basic kannada just to make it less easy for the other person you dont have to make it easy for then allow them to learn i do give shit to people who try to make it seem like its my fault for not knowing thier language specially the hindi ones try to claim we should know it cause its national language,1,2,1,North-India
the one thing ill say is in my 12 years in bangalore all my efforts in learning kannada were appreciated despite me butchering the language frequently while learning they understood that i was making an effort and i was offered corrections and kindness in those moments contrast this to my years in chennai trying to learn tamil almost every time i made a mistake i was laughed at ridiculed and slapped with this line that seemed to be a favourite at the time please neenga tamizh a kola pannadheenga literal translation please you dont kill tamizh hatred is always wrong but people should understand that they cannot hide behind the nuances of this difficult conversation to mask their own bigotry i dont want a local kannadiga to feel pressured into learning a new language just to please north indians or other south indians who have more means to learn a language than the people they demand english communication from,0,0,0,
in my experience as someone who grew up in bangalore in a nonkanada speaking family people generally dont care i cam speak enough kanada to not converse but to make it obvious that im genuinely trying the speed and accent i speak in give it away that im not a native speaker and from what i have seen most people appreciate that im trying to speak in a language im not comfortable with 910 times an auto driver will realise i am struggling with the language and will switch over to hindi from what i know the problem usually comes with the sort of people that shout kannada gothila and make zero effort to try speaking the language especially those that have lived for years people dont like it when you are someone sheltered earning multiple lakhs a month some cases and make no effort to try its those privileged assholes thay get in peoples nerves and bad sides cause those are the people who are well off and privileged enough to go to truffles toit and other places over and over without it even affecting their budgets there is a huge disconnect there the fact is a lot of people who dont speak or try to speak kanada are so privileged and isolated from real world problems that theyll never had to go out of their comfort zone and for what its worth when i was in bangalore i took a bmtc almost every day the conductors were super nice to me cause they knew me and rather every time i go to mumbai i get shit from people cause my hindi isnt good enough never had that issue in bangalore thats though i was there for 24 years ps im just shit with languages i speak hindi at home with parents 80 of the time and still struggle with the language,0,0,0,

i am a bengali not from wb and i speak bengali hindi english and tamil this is because i have lived in quite a few places in the country currently living in hyderabad for over a year and managed to pick up enough telugu that i can watch a movie without subtitles speaking is something that i havent managed yet i always feel like there should be an acceptance of the language differences from both sides and it is usually there when it comes to people of the state whether that be tamil telugu or kannadigas at the same time as someone not from the state i cannot at any point have this attitude that why does this person in hyderabad not know any language other than telugu i usually make do in situations like this only when it comes to a situation where it is absolutely important that i understand what is being said i ask the person to speak in english hindi or tamil and even then i apologize never had a problem with anyone and the funniest thing is that people make it out like its only people from the south who have a language problem try speaking in tamil or telugu in kolkata see how that works out at the end of the day ours is a country with multiple languages people who work in corporates will end up going to other states to work keeping an open mind and healthy attitudes towards our own limitations always helps,0,0,0,

bro let me tell you one thing if kannadigas are really hateful then so many lakhs of people would not be able to come and settle here and go about their lives without learning the language that too for decades there may be some instances where some asshats may have shown hatred but they are exactly what they areisolated incidents bangalore cannot give a service level agreement that says you will have a seamless experience if you do not learn the language rude behavior is experienced by kannada speaking people to be it from cops or auto driver or bus conductor i have experienced myself where a north indian got pissed because the driver of a cab did not understand hindi or english that well so he could not get the instructions isko koi samjaho na kuch bhi samajh mein nahi aata isko right in front of him i wondered who is more educated and capable of learning a new language among the two i once mentioned another north indian about an app i came across for learning kannada an the quick retort was a very rude why should i learn some wise guy commented why do you guys think you are above everyone else so same question here too sorry i have seen intolerance when a tamil song was playing in the cab not even kannada ye kya chal raha hai yaar so i as a kannadiga am not prepared to take the blame entirely sorry the senes are a different thing,0,0,0,

acceptance of another culture from a native persons end is one thing and that includes language as well according to me especially in our country because it defines a culture in a lot of ways but what generally happens nowadays is the clear disregard for the culture of the place people from the outside are currently part of why should flexibility only be a thing expected from the natives of a place why not from the people who are non natives acceptance will happen only when there is an integration to a culture and that doesnt mean you need to change who you are it just means you need to be flexible you can still be you why is there an ostracising happening here only of the people of the land why not question people who refuse to learn words required even for general commute why are cab drivers expected to be flexible or anyone in the service industry for that matter is it just because they are part of that industry its a clear double standard i stand with anyone who has faced a genuine issue and has been discriminated against even when theyve been understanding and adaptive to the culture and i apologize for that but thats clearly a very few and not the majority so your narrative just covers one perspective requiring people to be accepting of others no matter what but it doesnt take into account the mental state or perspective of people who are on the recieving end of all this criticism here,0,0,0,

i am from a north indian family but grew up in bangalore in a part of town where literally no one spoke kannada for 16 years i never needed to know kannada tamil was way more common and the most common language was english if not english we spoke in some amalgamation of hindi english and kannada and things worked fine fast forward to college which was on mysore road no one here spoke anything other than kannada which is normal considering it is bengaluru karnataka i picked up kannada gradually but in the mean time i struggled with translating specific words and using correct grammar i was often met with a complete lack of regard people ignored me and made no effort to accommodate me when i was struggling with explaining something that was rough later i moved to koramangala and worked in jp nagar here my broken kannada was kinda respected and people were a lot more willing to help someone who was in the process of learning the language i could switch between using kannada and englishhindi and people would try to meet me in the middle some people went so far as to appreciate my efforts my biggest issues as highlighted by others have been with cops and government officials who would just assume i was a northie and berate me in kannada when i would respond in kannada they would make fun of it but their attitude would change ever so slightly i was an outsider to both kannadigas and north indians i didnt speak kannada well and i didnt truly know north indian culture or hindi slang i think my opinion may be less biased considering i had to learn about both cultures but eventually i grew to become part of both cultures having grown up here i do see why kannadigas find north indian culture a little unruly north indians tend to be louder in general and i have seen disrespectful north indians as well i see why north indians have a tough time settling in because almost everyone up north knows a decent amount of hindi and it may seem weird that this part of india doesnt speak nearly as much hindi i think compromises are needed on both sides north indians need to be more aware of the culture they are coming into and be welcome to adapting a little kannadigas also need to understand that learning kannada is pretty hard for someone with no prior experience and absorbing culture takes a lot of time egos on both sides are the root cause of the problem my solution micro dose everyone on lsd by mixing it in the water supply the resulting ego death will make bangalore an amazing place s,1,1,1,Karnataka

unpopular opinion and i am bound to get downvotes but this has been on my mind for quite some time and needs to be told rude behavior from people of other states or expectation that everyone knows hindi is something that absolutely must not be tolerated even if someone knows or understands hindi one can definitely choose to not speak hindi we are a heterogeneous country after all having said that someone said about demand and supply being at the heart of an economically thriving bangalore and i want to emphasize on that a little bit part of the reason india has a substantial it industry is because we know english for us to become a preferred destination of outsourcing we had to speak the tongue of our formal colonial masters and we did that for the sake of employment now consider this a large part of bangalore economy is driven by people who are not native of karnataka and hence might not be comfortable or choose to speak kannnada suppose i am interacting with a kannadiga who is providing me a product or service in other words i am the customer and a kannadiga is a seller this can be bus conductors cab drivers vegetable sellers watchmen or anyone who is not comfortable in english the only way to do a transaction here is to speak a common tongue which can either be kannada or something else the question is whose expectation is reasonable when we compare with the situation of white collar workers speaking english at workplace whose convenience should get preference when you work at an american company do you insist that your american boss should talk in kannada if he has to run an office in bangalore no you gulp down your language pride and talk in english the language of the person who pays you does that make you forget your native language now apply the same logic to local interactions and transactions and the answer is obvious anything else is hypocricy,0,0,0,

exactly what i was trying to say its a rural community thats generally practically shut off from the outside world so the nice thing to do is integrate yourself there to the community and instead of doing that expecting extra is too much and people who are doctors and physios are generally looked at as a higher group in any society so the xenophobia she couldve faced wouldve been some curious questions that were found to be offensive by her because of fragility maybe not sure if it was anything more serious and if so that wouldve been wrong and unfortunate i mean theres always going to be a double standard and people are extra sensitive and take themselves way too seriously nowadays so these issues are going to remain,0,0,0,

adjust to make a living which they are i am really very grateful for that i live with my family here and i love this city without the warmhearted cooperation and hospitality of kannadigas i couldnt have made this city my home four languages you did all you could thats more than enough if i were the belt seller i would have simply given you the belt at the cost price and yes absolutely if someone is doing business at a ground level in karnataka he must learn the local language as i said its all about making the customer comfortable and doing good business make a living in south bangalore true kannada is more prevalent here even i have lived in padmanabhanagar for a good number of years and currently live in anjanapurakonankunte i only get by because my wife is fluent in kannada and of course the online deliveries of food grocery and everything else to any north indian reading my post please for gods sake dont be rude and entitled kannadigas have done enough to welcome us in their land even if you dont know kannada the least you can do is be polite towards all locals respect their culture and overall not behave like an entitled asshole i am guilty and ashamed of not making enough effort for learning the language but i make it a point to appreciate what has been given to me by bangalore for the nth time understand this hindi is not the national language and our country had no national language just because our parliament has the most number of seats from uttar pradesh doesnt mean other states their language and their culture is not important and if you still have any false sense of supremacy left draw a horizontal line across madhya pradesh and compare the gdp foreign investment tax contribution rate of literacy life expectancy women safety child mortality cleanliness etc above and below that line maharashtra gujrat karnataka tamil nadu kerala and andhra pradesh literally funds the rest of india and is above the national average for almost all social and public health indicators i came from west bengal and settled down in bangalore and god forbid if some day i have to choose between north and south india i will happily choose south india every single time its not only because of economic opportunities but the fact that in the current times the southern states are carrying the soul of the true indian culture rooted in humility tolerance and sustainability so once again be grateful for the generosity and hospitality and dont be an entitled asshole,1,2,3,North-India

you think everyone is entitled if they dont speak your language thats the problem not everyone has the time nor people around to teach them people come here to earn money and a large many of them stay temporarily they might move to another city probably the next month or next year i know many people who have moved to another state or gone abroad after working here it is not so easy to learn languages there are many people like me who cant remember or learn languages easily after reaching a certain age,0,0,0,

i am completely against not talking in hindi or for that matter not talking in a language that is not understood by everybody in the group i am really sorry that we tamilians have made your experience bad but i am not in for learning a third language to communicate when we already have a second language precisely for that matter if we still need one i would prefer that language to be one of the four south indian languages,1,1,1,Tamil Nadu

agree with the last statement and no i dont think it was offensive in any way shape or form since ive heard her stories it was more like her superiors scolding her for not being able to understand and communicate with the patients which is the bare minimum requirement for them i genuinely understands if people from my field i e it dont know to speak kannada since they dont really need it and can survive effortlessly but people from medical and banking sector its like a requirement but they refuse to satisfy it,1,1,1,Karnataka
bro sorry to tell you this but this pure entitlement if you can learn 4 languages because they were nessesary it only shows you dont respect the local language as it will take work you dont get to demand respect when you dont give any would you have the same argument if you moved countries and refused to learn their language,0,0,0,
the reason people sarcastically tell that to you is because you make them feel like outsiders behaving like outsiders and are hurt when treated like outsiders what kind of entitlement is this also proudly saying that you are living here for 6 years and havent even bothered to learn basic kannada you should be ashamed do you think anybody from the south could have lived in north for 6 years without learning your language,1,2,1,North-India
yeah yet were forced to learn hindi even when most of us dont migrate up there and youve the privilege of not learning a language because its hard yes thats why all the hate,1,2,1,North-India
this is definitely entitlement if you can learn 4 languages then you can learn another language as well even we indians arent privileged to be born in a developed country but if i were to go to germany i would learn german even south indians will learn hindi if they move to north especially for 6 years the sub isnt toxic youre the entitled one difference is in real life too people think youre entitled but kannadigas wont say it to your face as most are laid back and not confrontational if they ever got an anonymous platform to talk about you then theyll call you out,1,2,1,North-India
if we want to learn a new language itll probably be something that opens up new opportunities then why did you come here not new opportunities,0,0,0,

i was born in karnataka and my mothers parents live in karnataka my birth certificate is from karnataka you are using documentation to say you are kannadiga by birth to show how bad this analogy is my father was born in mysore as his dad was working in mysore at that time his birth certificate is from karnataka then his whole family shifted to his hometown shortly which is not karnataka but his extended family continued to live in karnataka he never learnt anything in kannada nor spoke in family by your logic my dad counts as kannadiga too i understand your mom is a kannadiga and technically your argument holds a little weightage but since you never practiced in home or follow anything in the culture it does not make you a kannadiga,0,0,0,

karnataka only state in south india that prefers regional language as medium of instruction udise report a large section of the population gets educated in kannada medium schools most people almost never use hindi or english in their day to day life i studied in bangalore and we had hindi for just three years from 5th to 7th standard from news to entertainment to culture to business almost everything happens in kannada so chances are most people you meet here are not fluent in hindi and would not be comfortable talking in hindi a lot of auto or cab drivers or shopkeepers or maids might not be educated in english once again realise that you are in a different part of the country with different language do you think i would be justified in complaining if i moved to delhi or kolkata and i find that the auto drivers or maids dont speak in kannada or english,1,1,1,Karnataka
yes i did both mean different things in different contexts that you failed to understand so let me explain one talks about someone holding a gun against someone else and saying learn my language or else no one is doing that here second talks about no one forcing a person but that person sitting on a high chair saying oh this language is not useful so i will not learn it point is one can go around spinning rhetoric being as aggressive as one can be without trying to understand what the other person is saying and you will only see strawmen we are indeed cool with people knowing zero kannada some of my best friends are from outside the state some have made attempts to learn kannada some have not but that has never been an issue in our friendship neither have i ever heard them complaining that they dont feel welcome or at home that maybe because they have some basic respect for the language culture and people respect and acceptance is mutual cannot be one sided not knowing the local language is one thing expecting that a local should know your language and getting pissed if that is not the case always is another thing comparing two different places and saying one is cooler than the other without knowing history and demographics does not make sense mumbai had been accepting immigrants much much before any city did most of the blue collar workers there are migrants from north not sure youve heard about backlash against them also there at some point hope you dont go to singapore and ask why i cannot use chewing gum or spit like in india or go to saudi and ask why i cannot drink fyi airlines are not supposed to serve alcohol when flying over their airspace even every place is unique and has its own way of life and acceptance levels to different things whether it makes sense to you or not learn to understand and appreciate it if you do want to compare though there are cities where the acceptance level is much lower as well i have lived in one such place briefly but i did not crib about it i bought a book and tried to learn the language i can even read that language now i watched tv programs in that language to pick up whatever i could there was no other choice at that time since hindi programs were also dubbed in the local languagetalking about doordarshan only days before cable and dth to me visiting or living in a place is about understanding and appreciating the local culture language and customs be it paris milan byrasandra or bommasandra without selfishly seeing utility in everything it is a small wonderful world that we live in and you dont know what will help in making your life better or in your quest to be a better person not the same for everyone i guess good for you take care,1,1,1,Karnataka
but the undertones are apparent just like in mumbai you can easily get along with english out here too its mostly with the blue collar workers that youd have to communicate in the local language which shouldnt be surprising in mumbai you didnt notice it since hindi was a common denominator which isnt the case here and neednt be so either,0,0,0,
it is not so easy to learn languages very true but at the same time its wayy easy to not criticize the locals for not knowing a non native language,0,0,0,
learning a new language takes a lot of time theres no reason to waste that time if theres already another language that both parties understand totally right but that shows ignorance 2 things here a person from south who doesnt know hindi cant go to mumbaidelhi etc and expect chill mumbaikars you can say the person knows english but you can interact only with english educated crowd in english and your day to day interactions involve the non educated crowd now this person no matter what he tries cant really get around and will attract unchill mumbaikars while in reverse people from mumbai can get around here because hindi is forced in schools for south people that exactly is what is called entitlement now for the 2nd part no one is requesting to learn the language but if you are staying here for work or day to day life then its not hard to just speak in basics basics can be picked up in just a day this is to just respect the place and culture you are in people learn germanfrench before going there for studies and even get it certified but moving to different culture in same country is seen as i cant put that much effort people are expecting you not to speak free flowing local language its not hard to pick up whats your name how much is this give me 2 kggive me 2 nos of it how are you are you fine etc etc these are bare basics but people who stay in the city for even a decade dont pick up this if thats not entitlement or lack of interest to local land i dont know what is that effort should come from self but they are not willing to put this because over in north or mumbai you get around with hindi,1,1,1,Karnataka
nobody is bullying people who are trying to learn kannada and speaking in kannada read through the thread there are people saying that they find locals helpful when they speak to them in kannada they are only facing problems at govt offices which happens all over the country the only people facing bullying from the locals are the ones who think they are better than the local people and the local need to learn and speak to them in their language instead,0,0,0,

hey dont you think youre painting a skewed picture of a rather warm and friendly crowd maybe you got into a tussle with some locals or had an incident with bus conductors or auto guys i really dont think kannadigas of all people would show animosity towards people not learning their language im exhibit a ive lived all my life here i even have friends who did there schooling here studied the language in school yet cant speak it and have never come across that argument sure there have been political weirdos doing their shit but the residents themselves arent anything like that also knowing basic words in the language of the city you live in is not too much to ask for,0,0,0,
obviously communication will be a problem in such cases but there will still not be any animosity an auto driver for example will make efforts to understand your english through gestures you are over simplifying by saying there will be just communication problem everything will feel difficult and even when you interact with educated office crowd you will feel left out a person coming down from here not knowing hindimarathi will find it very tough to be part of social circles office and everything and its not the localites fault its the individual fault for not having learnt the basics of language assimilating with local culture instead the individual will say people are unwelcoming we are all indians bangalore belongs to all indians just because the majority of the people in the city speak a language doesnt mean everyone must try to blend in btw similar bs arguments are used by hindipushers who claim that everyone in india should learn hindi just because thats the most popular language overall its the same appeal to majority and a bogus line of thinking again expecting people to pickup basics is not wrong and is not imposition if anything thats a given if i go to gujaratnorth east etc and work there on day to day basis i would expect local social circle me to expect basics from me over the time your argument wouldnt hold anywhere if you are moving to another country you go to non english european countries or east asian countries for work and your work circle social circle public would expect local language from you are you telling me you would go to work to francegerman without learning i bet not india is also unique in that sense that each state is a new culture in itself with own languages and stuff due to skewed centres policies hindi is put down among south people via school and hence it has become easy dialogue of x city is for all remove hindi from the equation and you wouldnt be able to say that,0,0,0,

as a tamil we get branded as villains by the rest of the country for not talking in a language we dont know bruh and someone has spread this stupid myth that tamils dont speak in hindi despite knowing it which cannot be farther from the truth 90 of tamils in tn dont understand hindi what usually happens is that a north indian visits bangalore or lives in the city and gets by in the city with just hindi then he visits chennai one day and starts talking hindi to locals and when people who dont know the language give weird stares locals get branded as rude and racists lol,1,2,1,Tamil Nadu
so you think that one language is better or more useful over the other and you will learn a new languagr only if it is useful implying that some languages are useless every language has it place beauty and importance and only high strung ignorant racist people can say what you said pity you cant see that from the high chair that you are sitting on on one breath you say you dont have time to learn a new language in another breath you say you will learn one if it helps you you assume not speaking the local language is indecent thats your problem no one has said it is indecent not learning and then complaining that everyone here is not accepting as xyz place and telling someone that their language has no value is far beyond indecent again if you dont want to learn dont lesrn but dont give lame arguments about utility and insult a language that is spoken by a population that is equivalent to that of germany or france whose languages you so much want to learn god bless you,0,0,0,

my point is simple the language of the local in tn is tamil the language in north india is hindi if the tamil goes to live in hindi or he tours north india hell either learn hindi or speak in english he wouldnt speak in tamil to the locals in north india and cry that the locals of north india are rude for not responding back in tamil when you visited tn you should have either talked in tamil which tbf is impractical because you were visiting for a short time and you couldnt have learnt it or talked in english but then again not everyone in india is fluent in english so if you and the local cannot converse its pure bad luck when you visit tn and expect the local who doesnt know hindi to speak in hindi youre just being a dick,1,2,1,Tamil Nadu

im a person born and brought up in delhi and this post randomly popped up in my feed theres a little i wish to say op claims that delhi people view bangalore very negatively as per my experience this isnt true when a person from delhi moves to bangalore others view it as major achievement and even a mark of sophistication for the said individual this appreciation is not restricted to mere jobs bangalores culture of life and amenities are also seen as being enviable the only point on which bangalore is criticised is the behaviour of autowallahs but since delhincr is itself prone to hooliganism most still view bangalore in a very favourable light if op is saying all this just in an attempt to be a keyboard warrior then its a quite pathetic thing to do but if op is not doing such a thing then it seems that op has somehow found himself surrounded by individuals who see criticism even unwarranted one as a means of initiating casual conversation its true that one can find online delhi people being excessively critical of bangalore but such people are merely some keyboard warriors trying to amuse themselves these people are unfit for representing the opinions and beliefs of the very people they claim to represent,0,0,0,

i mean youll find most of them on this sub itself every other post tries to exaggerate and self victimize themselves since there is no fact check im sure most of these are just here for karma hunting with repetitive posts hundreds of my friends from north have settled here and there have been not a single instance of them being discriminated against even after staying here for a decade while posts on this sub be like i arrived to bengaluru 1 month back and auto goons beat me up for not speaking kannada just a few days there was a post on how a poor farmer was denied entry to metro and comments were like kannadigas are discriminating and all the blame was on locals all this just just shows the authenticity and level of moderation on this sub they might as well name it anti bangalore,0,0,0,
this is all over india people in pune mumbai acts like delhi is a warzone i have met people in blr who told me their infrastructure including public transport is better than delhi delhi people think blr peeps attack every north indian as someone who is from nowhere and lived all over its just frustrating be kind with each other,0,0,0,
lol banglore does not have public transport and shop signs in any language other than the local language if we had kept all the boards in marathi then idiots like you wouldve come to fight us for how mumbainot bombay is not inclusive but its alright if the other states put boards on public transport and shops only in local language and not in 2 or 3 languages so that everyone can understand them biased views just because you lived there and not in mumbai,0,0,0,
except air pollution and water problem which all happens bcoz of people like us bangalore is great however i dont like the hooliganism that some linguistic groups do by getting money from politicians i was extremely joyed when they announced that kannada would be compulsory for all businesses but then they started taking down english language altogether how would i understand their language my mother tongue is neither hindi nor english i am in bengaluru bcoz my company needed me there if the company wants me somewhere else i will be elsewhere how can i learn every local language fluently also those hooligans do not understand that without outside people real estate value wouldnt be as worth most businesses like restaurants would not see as many customers i strongly believe every state should promote their local culture but they need to keep in mind that thosr who stay there on a temporary basis would not want to be enforced on these cultures and languages i have a few kannadians near my pg who are extremely extremely helpful and even speak broken hindi so that people like us dont have problems but the actions done by the hooligans is not justifiable at all,1,1,1,Karnataka

im a marathi from mumbai and i have lived in bangalore for a little time i faced much less discrimination here than my own state i wasnt refused a house by a landlord because im a marathi i have found kannadigas to be humble and respectful people just because they place importance on their culture doesnt mean they are rude all educated kannadigas ive met have been extremely polite and humble to me you might have few bad experiences with autowalas but understand that they are less educated people in any state theyll behave rouge as a marathi person ive only felt accepted and welcomed by the native kannadigas,1,1,1,Karnataka

another day another north vs south post sigh honestly i feel like this is a post for karma whoring because in my experience most north indian people especially in tech wanna move to blr because of the opportunities and weather obviously the villainisation of blr is a bit too extreme at times but its not unwarranted the city has started becoming more and more unsafe even to locals and some of the local population treat migrants like they are only in bengaluru due to the benevolence of the locals the main issue was and has been that the government does fuckall for the city metro lines are built 95 but were still waiting on the last 5 majority of the city not having municipal water is crazy,1,1,1,Karnataka

embracing multilingualism is immensely beneficial being an indian from the south ive found that knowing multiple languages including hindi facilitates easy communication with people from different parts of india when you speak their language it fosters a sense of welcome and acceptance moreover it encourages them to reciprocate the effort by learning your language its important to approach interactions with respect and kindness rather than rudeness as language is deeply intertwined with cultural significance while the debate over the imposition of kannada persists its not unique to karnataka but prevalent across southern india due to the significant migrant population particularly in bangalore learning a few basic words in the local language like for rickshaw or cab can go a long way in establishing rapport and earning respect disregard those who insist on language imposition the barking dog never bites iykyk,0,0,0,

lol when my grandfather moved to assam in the 60s he was told the same shit like its basically a jungle and other bs regardless it wasnt like what they all said and he built a good life for us all in assam even though i didnt have that good of an experience in bangalore because of my college and the fact i was not living in the main city but the outskirts i dont think it was a bad place at all it was pretty nice and the climate was also similar to my hometown funnily enough every fellow north indian i knew in bangalore was telling me to not go to delhi saying that it was not a good place and unsafe for women i would get raped and all other things i did end up moving to delhi and im happy here about the language imposition i think its kinda bs yes they taught kannada in their colleges just like how hindi is mandatory in du colleges and they have a right to propagate their language plus knowing the local language helps a lot with cultural assimilation and the locals warming up to you since i grew up in assam i can understand and speak assamese so can most members of my family,1,2,1,Assam
the whole mindset of people buying cars are the villains of traffic is so pathetic people put in a lot of hardwork to be able to afford a car they pay the highest tax in india to buy that car which is meant for proper road and traffic management development this is state tax and not central so dont crib the state doesnt get a fair share every major city in the world has dealt with immigration crisis people flock into big cities and over population caused issues but they bring more revenue and jobs as well its the states responsibility to account for that if you give incentives and approvals to build massive tech parks you need to plan for the influx of population take noida for example in a decade they have changed so much given incentives for tech parks and at the same time built world class infrastructure people have a right to complain and criticise poor infrastructure especially if its a good chunk of their income that goes for funding it fyi the north south divide is there in southern states only places like delhi dont give a shit who comes they literally served the entire northern belt for decades for healthcare education transportation,0,0,0,

most of my friends from the north have 0 clue about the southern cities all they do is crib and complain about our southern cities while they come from small towns they dont even have the basic knowledge about the southern states and all their complaints and rants are based on some half baked information i had to explain to one of my friends from delhi that kerala tamilnadu andra telangana and karnataka are 5 different states with different languages spoken i kid you not this is the truth and that fellow was about 25year old possibly from a reputable school and college because he had a posh englishand we were in an it company so please dont say that he might not be educated or anything so as much as i hate generalization but i do notice a lot and a lot of people from the north are extremely unaware and ignorant and i also noticed they prefer to be ignorant when we try and explain about our city so that they can remain superior in their heads,1,2,1,South-India

north indian here arrived in bangalore for studies 18 years have passed since then out of those 18 i lived in delhi for about 3 one thing i notice in delhi and surrounding areas ncr is the boastfullness and fakenarratives which are twisted by people to make themselves feel superior to others you think they do this to karnatakabangalore i think you are wrong they do this to everyone i have seen and heard and overheard people craptalking about every place with some general batshit crazy logic and sentiment north east they are all apparently insect eaters which is not true because i have been there orissa oh the tribals are so barbaric bihar majdoors only uncivilized yada yada maharashtra marathis are so brutal towards nonmarathi people tamilnadu tamilians wont talk in anything except tamil kerala keralites are so dark skinned rajashtan rajasthani people are supposedly very eager to pickup fight and are fake rajputs and whatever jk kashmiris are spreading hate everywhere and i can go on most people who talk all this have been nowhere for them ncr is best people are honest here and most civilized and whatnot not true in 3 years there i never repeat never felt like home i speak hindi mostly and except the language part i did not feel at home bangalore with broken kannada on my end and broken hindi on kannadigas end feels way more athome than delhi ever did the air there always reeked of malice for me as if people would rather sell me for money if they could that being said yes i made friends there and those were well educated civilized chill people but the general consensus that i have felt in ncr is ncr is best all others are vermins and are just populating and polluting the country and should be avoided all this while they didnt bother calling even police for 3 hours seeing a naked half dead girl on a busy road nirbhaya issue i much rather think that people from north have spoiled the culture of bangalore i am also from north and it is sad that i have to say it but i do think thats what the truth is bangalore was the land of decent people with simple life girls here felt so motherly i would respect them more than anything else looking at that same i got skin so i gotta show it attitude has ruined it and guess which state people have the most contribution in my observation yeah you guessed it right to op dont be scared with what they say delhi is full of people who are more fluff than anything else they do it for fun let them have it and stay away they have nothing better to do than badmouth just about everyone else,0,0,0,

in fact i think that the kannadigas didnt care that outsiders came and settled and started working until these same outsiders started discriminating against them it is simply not an attack but a retaliation minding your own business and not using a certain language in conversations is not discrimination grow up but if a bangalorean says you are the traffic you should leave then they are the horrible people yes they are horrible people if they ask others to leave a place in their own country for complaining about the traffic a sensible person will ask them to use public transport and civic authorities to improve their transit network,1,1,1,North-India

i also have an army background but i must agree that bangalorean locals suck bangalore is one of the best places ive stayed in i completed my college here and have been working here for almost 2 years but the best people ive met in bangalore are also migrants i do respect the fact that culture should live on but culture should not be enforced i own a flat in bangalore and stay in it that in itself is enough grounds for locals in my work place to get upset since i dont speak the language i would get unwarrented comments for not going to south indian places for lunch or for bringing sandwiches to my workplace the bus conductor the auto drivers and shop keepers all seem to have a problem with people who arent from here not just the locals in your workplace i feel like it is a deep sense of insecurity towards the hindi speaking community in the north but i for one dont care about either language much since i primarily speak english and can barely speak hindi dont get me started on the entitlement men from bangalore have they just expect the outsiders to work harder which most people who shift here for work actually tend to do literally no one cares where you were born if youre not contributing any differently to society i havent even mentioned the cops yet but god thats a diff tangent altogether fuck the locals and their mamas,0,0,0,
yes it is true that bengaluru is an advanced city but i dont believe its gonna stay this way if the local unemployed people show this kind of resistance to development india wouldnt have where it is if we didnt have the most english speakers in the world you need that because thats the international language and its vital for big development its not that people wouldnt respect the culture or language but the hostility and aggressiveness of the people here is something else ive been living here since years and i can tell you that its slowly becoming unwelcoming everyday and probably they want a new country just for instance there was a huge drama when kashmere demanded a separate flag for its state however here anywhere you go youll find the kannada flag rarely have i seen a tricolour here even on independence days which is truly worrying,0,0,0,

most north indians are very narrow minded till twenty years back they would have just called you a madrasi not even acknowledged that you are something different also being dark in skin tone is a big problem for them and a lot of up people are also darktoned and those people suffer all their lives from a very explicit bullying right from their childhood all that said the extreme regionalism is indeed an issue in bangalore nowhere else a state day is celebrated even whereas in bangalore you find auto drivers with those yellowred flags moving around and it is the auto drivers that is the main problem they can literally harass and bully you if you dont speak kannada since you bring up maharashtra it is not at all an issue there in fact i have never met so nice taxi and auto people as in bombay and pune when talking of big cities auto drivers in bangalore especially if they are hindus are a terror to encounter i say hindus not because of bringing some religion angle but because the muslims of bangalorehyderabad area speak deccani urdu so they dont mind the north indians and are civil to them and even mostly nice as they are often old and philosophical it seems that the younger generation from shivajinagar is not much into driving autos and bangalore does have a traffic problem it is not because people have migrated here that is the story with any big city in the world that is no excuse to not build a proper infrastructure it is because the corruption problem the greed of locals is extreme i have never seen so much corruption anywhere in india as in bangalore at the municipal and political and builder lobby level and anyone who says you should leave is horrible who decides who should leave,1,2,1,North-India

they say i am blind to the realities its not you its them until these same outsiders started discriminating against them it is simply not an attack but a retaliation truth they have to come out of the mentality that bengaluru is what it is because of them and about the language imposition it started when hindi imposition was put on us are people wrong in defending their language their culture and its not just hindi if you see in bengaluru its filled with people from bordering states and even they dont learn the language and impose their language its obvious that kannadigas feel frustrated about losing their language and retaliate now if i get a job in some northern state or even say chennai or hyderbad and i say i dont know hindi tamil telugu even after staying there for long enough to learn the language what would be their reaction but if kannada folk do the same we are called names made inferior and bullied the hypocrisy the attitude that why should we learn kannada you learn hindi has to stop learning the local language is very helpful and respectful to the place and it should be common courtesy im not saying you should be fluent with proper grammar and vocabulary just enough to have a proper conversation,1,1,1,Karnataka
i dont know which north you have gone but i never heard anything much bad about bengaluru there yes people talk about traffic problems there but thats it why people will call local karnataka people as tribal when they dont have much knowledge about the history and culture of karnataka and why will they hate for no reason stop spreading hate please,0,0,0,

i feel it might be something to do with an echo chamber northies you are hanging out with i am a delhiite for most part studied and worked there 20 years moved to bangalore a couple of year ago and even though we had to transplant the whole family kids elderly everyone in my extended family and friends circle has been extremely supportive like there were a few questions of why 1 pollution but also 2 i wanted to expose my kids to more diversity than the homogeneity of delhi gurgaon upper middle class social strata am pretty happy with my decision so far the only thing i would say is people locals who complain about the traffic are probably folks who were used to a different pace of life and roads i mean sure the roads could be wider and that contributes to the jams but my commute time in bangalore is similar to an intragurgaon commute and so many people in delhi who do delhinoida or delhigurgaon or even gurgaonnoida are stuck in traffic far longer so in a nutshell not everyone thinks that way and am sorry for the racist bias you experienced,1,1,1,Karnataka

i agree with your observations but i have learned a much sadder and shameful truth most indians are like this only the degree varies it is in my opinion an extension of what i call the raja beta syndrome where people think everything should be to their liking served without raising a finger also preferably the way it is at home and free of cost when things dont work they dont accept their failure or flaws but blame society i was born in bangalore but have lived abroad for several years and also speak and understand a number of languages other than kannada so i know the conversations in closed groups do you know how irritating it is when these idiots leave the country for better prospects come to a safer more prosperous society get all possible privileges and then say arre yahan ka khana kitna pheeka bland hai yahan sab kitna same lagta hai boring hai india jaisa nahi hai yahan koi culture nahi hai humare yahan toh and i am not exaggerating when i say that these people have the audacity to express the same thing to the local people us european australian as the case may be and they behave like they are a head of the state complaining we have to wash our own dishes and clothes there is no maid in such a developed country yes because other countries respect fellow human beings and dont exploit poor people for cheap labour i once had this person visiting australia tell me yaar yahan ka beach bakwas hai india mein kitna vibrant hota hai i got fed up and said beach tumhare jaise bol chal nahi sakta na toh kya karega varna thoda dance ya music seekh ke tumhe entertain karta tum india vapas jake hi enjoy karo it takes a depraved mind to insult a part of the world that is virgin and protected from littering and pollution and call it boring,0,0,0,

hahahaha delhi might be a more important city to you probably not just the rest of india but the rest of the world doesnt seem to agree with you most of the corporate hq of top mncs are based out of bangalore it is only because the government made delhi the capital that a few companies that require the proximity to the union government like defence drone companies and a few marketing related organisations roles that are based out of your important city if that was the case all your educated youth wouldnt have been coming to bangalore hyderabad chennai pune mumbai to study or work just check out the statistics as to how many south indians live in delhi and how many north indians live in the aforementioned cities youll come to know which place is more important and sought after,1,1,1,South-India
its a stereotype which is half true as above guy said its parents mentality older generation still believe in caste and other outdated ideas but for this particular scenario the guy is probably a student most north indian students in south are usually rich they write private exam which middle class north indians cant affordmost nis are more expressive and usually spend time outside so the general si has this view so you have a demographic who are rich and hence you also have rotten apples among them in short its a stereotype which has some truth to it,0,0,0,

its an inequality problem it companies move in lots of money comes in lots of people from outside the state and suddenly rent goes up and necessities become more expensive for the locals who arent getting those ridiculous it salaries the brewing resentment gets channeled into hatred against nonlocals and minorities by politicians this could be said for both hyderabad and bangalore but this problem is not as prevalent in hyderabad because the governance is slightly less corrupt and there has been a significant focus on infrastructure and urban development and expansion of city borders the poorer people still have inequality reasons to complain about but theres ample opportunity for them to be employed and maintain a stable livelihood and they benefit from the infrastructure just like the rich do,1,1,1,South-India
too much development too fast esp fucking bangalore which gives me a headache everytime i visit its like watching some bizarre reality show where stone age ppl and paris hilton are dealing with each other lot of insecurity frustration disconnection alienation etc not everyone has benefited or can benefit that doesnt excuse any one from being an assole but its not hard to understand why ppl are on edge waiting for a button to be pushed,0,0,0,

hot take this is all downstream from the failure of settling on a national link language it couldnt be hindi for historical reasons but shouldve been english everyone should just learn two languages mother tongue english that would solve a lot of these issues another issue is that indians still mostly think of immigration as emigrating abroad many are just now waking up to the increasing inmigration within india it will not slow down turns out that india is more racist than most western countries and yes the tolerant south is a giant meme,0,0,0,

i maybe wrong but such behaviour is a result of the aggressive hindi push by the union govt its almost a counterreaction because the union govt is hellbent on pushing hindi down the throat of nonhindi speakers some section of nonhindi speakers have become overprotective of their own language which in turn is manifesting into hatred towards common people who dont speak their language,0,0,0,

where are you from if youre from north india im sorry but i gotta be honest here its due to your politicians and some of you not all of you let me tell you my personal story i am not from karnataka but from kerala when i was about 13 years old i was in a site called teenchat and there were indians from various parts in the indian room all of them were speaking in hindi because most of them were from north a guy asked me something in hindi to which i replied i dont know hindi he asked me are you indian and i said of course and they laughed at me saying youre an indian and you dont know hindi i said no you dont know the national language of india i said no i tried to make them understand that india has many languages and weve different cultures and so on and they laughed at me again it hurt me so much it was because i didnt know why they were mocking me also imagine the plight of a 13 year old boy they also called me some local hindi slurs i googled it they also called me a black boy even when i am actually brown i didnt even know that it was a racial fight but once i knew it i was so relieved next day i called a couple of my malayali friends and called them the nastiest things that we can call someone and all of these north indians left the chat in fact they left the chat out of fear of getting abused not something to be proud of when they spoke hindi we abused them to the point where they were really afraid to speak hindi we literally transformed it from a hindi to a malayalam room later i saw north indians being beaten up in kerala because they spit pan in front of stores and more but the point here is if you become racist to a group of people they will give it back to you especially when they live in better conditions than you its just time until they understand that youre attacking them what happened in kerala north indians are speaking fluent malayalam for the most part and they respect the culture tradition and heritage what happened in india north indians are slowly understanding that hindi is not the national language your case might be the same may be youre a nice man but what can we do respect their culture tradition and things will be alright,1,2,1,North-India

firstly dont blame karnataka because of the actions of a few people whatever a few people face is mostly just built up anger basically a few ignorant and arrogant people outsiders are responsible for the accumulation of such rage people who come to bengaluru or karnataka dont bother to learn the local language and just expect everyone in bengaluru to speak in hindi which pisses a lot of people because they are the ones coming to our city and their responsibility to learn and communicate in kannada example when people go to other countries like japan they make sure to learn and communicate in the language no matter how hard it is but are not willing to do the same in karnataka just like how you cant expect everyone in japan to reply in english you cant expect everyone in karnataka to reply in hindi when people are asked to learn kannada they just are very ignorant and give replies like why should i learn kannada this is one of the main reason why the innocent people who actually put efforts to learn face such anger all we want is for people who come to our state to respect our culture just learn the language atleast basics and see how much more love you are going to get from the locals,1,2,1,Karnataka

this is nothing new if you locals always have been hating the immigrantsjust take the example of usa where local population have some elements who show racism with indians there have been some cases in australia toothe same is happening in the india if we take account of such it growth and development in such short period then it might be the reason of xenophobia among locals indian population have been racist from a long time it doesnt matter whether its northern part or southern for example the way people treat bihari migrants who do mostly labour work in other states for better wages in my case i havent received any sort of racism across the india probably because i mostly visit for ngo and social work all i can say such racist behaviour is shown mostly by people of middle class or the ones without a job,0,0,0,

basically the country is not developing its villages and towns so jobs are not created due to lack of infrastructure in other places and this prompts people to come running to banglore where competition is high and prices utilities and traffic has increased obviously locals will feel resentment and to add fire yall speak hindi see we are all humans and we do accommodate but we also fall back to blame game when things are tough and my suggestion is overthrow the government and put salman khan as supreme leader he will ensure proper development and make sanjay dutt as minister of interior,0,0,0,

job distribution issues it appears that there has been a lack of proper distribution of job opportunities for people from karnataka it would be ideal if each company in karnataka had a representation of at least 25 from the state it is noteworthy that most companies in india are servicebased rather than productbased therefore the skills required to work in the it sector may not necessarily involve research and development unfortunately it is not uncommon to observe instances where people are hired based on their regional background where calls are conducted only in hindi and where groupism based on regionalism is practiced similarly there are instances where projects are allocated based on the candidates regional affiliation which can lead to the rejection of candidates from other states or those who do not speak a certain language,0,0,0,

this is bs most societies dont and didnt like immigrants throughout history because the culture food number of people who look like you languages change when mass immigration happens not to mention mass immigration brought diseases at least historically its more of ingroup outgroup things and no society is immune to that its inherent to humans blame evolution if you want if anything its actually natural that people feel this way my hometown is in pune district where people follow sharad pawar more religiously than an rindian follows rahul baba or a bhakt follows modi and they all hate the mass immigration none of them are influenced by bjp i understand shitting on bjp for everything is almost a requisite on rindia but things arent as straight forward i live in mumbai and am marathi speaker studied both hindi and marathi in school when i talk to strangers i inadvertently talk in hindi maybe mumbai went through the resentment phase before i was even born and its very tolerant now i suspect pune will go through this phase too albeit the issue in pune is not even remotely close to that of south pretending the intolerance in south came into existence after 2014 is just ignorance south has been very intolerant relative to at least mahashtrians because i can only speak for maharashtrians for quite some time probably because of isolated society less exposure to nonsouth indian things maybe insecurities idk youll find gujratis rajasthanis pretty much everywhere in any indian city they usually own shops and not really taking away the native peoples jobs not to mention being tolerant to people you know for 3 generations is different than strangers who are taking your jobs damn i wouldnt be surprised if these northies you mention speak the state language outside their homes apologies for any typos typed this on phone,1,1,1,South-India

bengaluru became bengaluru because of kannadigas not outsiders it was kannadigas who created an amazing tech ecosystem outsiders are just coming here because their states doesnt have as good job opportunities as karnataka hence huge influx into the state not just bengaluru but other towns such as mangalore mysore belagavi,1,1,1,Karnataka
bengaluru was center of innovationmadras sappers hal isro before it industry came into existence and also dont forget it is the geographical center of south india any industry would have thrived in bangalore but it couldnt have survived in india without the infrastructure that bangalore was able to provide in the 80s and 90s then it will like any other kannadiga city im damn sure any other kannadiga city is much better than most other north indian cities,0,0,0,
this is somthing a person who hasnt researched about the topic would say lmao the mysore state was said to be in the forefront of civic development bringing about radical changes in the field of education health and industry theres a reason why bangalore was and has always been a rd hub folks in karnataka especially south canara are very educated so much so that mangalore was known as the cradle of indian banking education is highly valued here and calling it another mp and up would be totally wrong because without the it boom bangalore was still forward looking and a hub for education aeronautics and rd blame the current situation towards gross civic mismanagement,1,2,2,Karnataka

i accept your point on immigrants being hated throught history and center includes not just bjp but congress too congress tried hindi imposition in many forms throught years and thats one of the significant reason for rise of dravidian movement in tn yes bombay had brief moment of unjust because of immigrants and it was more aggressive i only know much about tamils being bashed in the streets of bombay im not aware of other minorities likes of varadarajan mudaliyar became saviour of immigrant tamils because of how deadly it was heck even state politicians were favouring anti tamil rhetorics back then mumbai is pretty tolerant now ig but you cant say current stuff is as bad as 70s mumbai i didnt say intolerance started from 2014 it was like that since early 2010s theres gonna be a crowd like purist rednecks wholl forever be anti immigration and theyre not redeemable current political unrest just amplifies it in much bigger scale paving way for local politicians attention seekers to spread their purist rhetoric and yes i studied in a jain school and most nindians dont speak much tamil we basically brand ourselves as chennai lets outsiders prosper,1,2,1,Maharastra

good response i disagree with your characterisation of kannada activists as ideologyless though on the contrary i think theyre the only ones who are working towards a solution for karnataka youre right that this is a complicated issue languages statehood decentralisationfederalisation need to be strengthened through policies which we dont have at the moment and as a result people are making arguments that arent backed up by any laws eg you should learn kannada in karnataka there has been a huge amount of migratory pressure placed on karnataka in the last 20 years and this pressure inevitably falls on kannadigas who have had to adapt to these changes in demographics and languages all in a short span of time this is all while kannadigas have been historically disenfranchised in the various erstwhile states that they were from before karnataka was formed with the exception of the mysuru state which blessed to have a kannada leader representing its people there is clearly a problem in karnataka today of people thinking that they dont need to learn the language of the state when they live here for years and years this is in contrast to tamil telugu migrants from decades ago who really made sure to learn the language and use it in all walks of life even if this didnt have any economic consequences it would be arrogant to assume people should learn the language you speak when everyone in the state speaks a different language but even on top of that by not respecting the language of the state it literally prices people out of their own markets and opportunities for upliftment yanked get away by a language barrier for poorer kannadigas who really need it the most back to the activists i think theyre doing a good job and providing some light for kannadigas in these dark times theyre clearly focused on making kannada the primary language of the state as it should be for the betterment of the people of the state and are trying to increase its market share through dubbing in kannada including informational content developing science in kannada supporting government kannada schools demanding kannada use through all official means supporting kannadigas when theyre denied essential services in their own state because they cant speak hindi anyway i know i sound like a mouthpiece for a kannada activism but i genuinely support them in their goal and i find it noble our issue in karnataka is a political one where our government isnt really representing our people nor is it working for our people we have massive fdi coming in to our state but somehow we cant do anything to alleviate poverty jn uttara karnataka theres enough money to build statues before elections but somehow spending money to build new public schools and hospitals thatd benefit people of karnataka is not i hope this changes fyi im not in support at all of violence and any activist that resorts to this is not an activist but a thug,1,2,3,Karnataka
you clearly fail to understand what the folks here are trying to convey discrimination on the basis of language or location should stop every sane bangalorean would agree to this and honestly dont give two shits about where their neighbours are from because theyve got bad roads poor drainage dumbfuckery of civil planning to worry about the thing people are trying to convey is that bangalore wasnt something that grew only because of the northies or the immigrants that sort of egoist and privileged thinking of we built this city ourselves and thus the natives must respect and accept us is wrong and youd be surprised that a considerable proportion of folks think this way bangalore wasnt a shit hole before the it boom it was infact a well developed and pleasant city comparable to pune with very small town vibes id love to go back to the time when bangalore ended till banashankari and people were very chill and easy going it was known to be a pensioners paradise due to its laid back vibes but good populace bangalore both under the wodeyars and the general indian government saw tremendous development before the 90s itself the city unlike chennai delhi mumbai or kolkata has not had the advantage of concentrated british infrastructure development to create grounds for urbanisation bangalore will always remain a source of talent not because its an it hub but because its an education hub the latter is the reason why the former took place bangalore has most of indias premier colleges for every stream iisc nlsiuiimb nift christ and countless more if i take karnataka as a whole then the debate ends karnataka is a hub for education the dakshina kannada region has universities comparable to places in pune and mumbainitk for example when you have such excellent colleges you will perennially attract a good student crowd and thus its logical for any company to set up their base of operations here because its cost effective in two ways 1 recruitment you know specific locations where youll find skilled labour and thus would concentrate on such locations and get the best among the available 2work by setting up base of operations in bangalore you reduce cost of migration as well as the psychological costs involved for the person to adjust to a new location and its culture kannadigas werent villagers before the it booms infact id say them to be very qualified our family comes from a tiny village near udupi and 90 of the folks there are charted accountants the northern region of karnataka has historically been backward and majority of the reasons for such backwardness is government apathy in the present and administrative apathy shown by the nizams in the past if you look at all the past regions ruled by the nizams youd see this common problem of underdevelopment except for the hyderabad region ive lived in maharashtra for 4 years now and something that has always interested me is the disparity in development and income between folks living in the marathwada region and the rest of the state marathwada region of maharashtra is the hyderabad karnataka equivalent and both states have suffered historically from administrative apathy i just wish someone changes it soon especially in karnataka because cities like belgaum dharwad and hubli are excellent places to have a sound industrial base karnataka unlike maharashra has always been bangalore focused so you dont see much development in other cities places like mangalore have a very literate population comparable to mumbai in these parameters with some competent folks in finance banking was something that originated in mangalore with most of your major banks having been set up by a mangalorean after independence one could see such banks being nationalised and shifted to bangalore and delhi which ultimately defeats the purpose of development if one wants to blame all this divisive stuff happening in karnataka id rather blame it on politics and vested interests its not something new under the bjp but the majority of the populace doesnt support discrimination rather its mainly the folks backed by political clout who do this calling karnataka the up of south india blatantly reeks of elitism inspite of the fact that people in tamil nadu kerala telengana and andhra pradesh usually come to karnataka for work cities like mangalore are filled with malayalis but you dont see people raising a ruckus over it cities like belgaum are filled with marathis and kannadigas alike but you dont see folks raising ruckus over it except during poll times in karnataka and maharashtra unsurprisingly bangalore has seen too much growth with too little infrastructure development this is why there is a lot of discontent among the localities i dont approve of their behaviour and its wrong to target folks just because theyre from the north east or west of the country but its ultimately the only way they think they can highlight their own plights it saddens me to see how bangalore has declined after the 90s it was known to be one of the best cities to live before the it boom and people still continue to suggest bangalore as a place to settle down and have a family hyderabad and pune coming a close second it is due to all these factors that bangalore not mumbai or even delhi has the largest expat population in the country hope people wake up and start loving the city for what it is and not who it is because bangalore is not a sum zero contribution of north indians or south indians its a success story for india and can show how if one with an open mind and broad social outlook can create a dynamic city from scratch edit spelling mistake,1,2,3,South-India

the issue at hand is not related to reservation but rather the right to work in ones own state it is not just about providing jobs to local people as they already reside in the state but about offering opportunities for them to develop their skills and progress in their careers if they possess the necessary qualifications it is important to note that a majority of the it companies in india are serviceoriented and provide at least one month of training to all their employees moreover since these companies cater to clients in the us and europe the ability to communicate effectively in english is crucial which many kannadigas are already capable of therefore it would be beneficial to consider hiring more local candidates who possess the required qualifications and skills which could result in more career growth opportunities for them in their home state,0,0,0,
about tolerance to south indians in 60s didnt i already mention that the collateral damage happened before i was even born i never refuted it lmao and trust me i wasnt born in the 60s if you have to bring something that happened 5060 years ago in an extremely poor very illiterate deeply isolated and orthodox india for comparison to something that happens today in south that says a lot isnt it south doesnt attract immigration to nearly same level as maharashtra does heck half of my neighbourhood friends were from south mostly kerala and some were from tamilnadu the influx of northies in south is way more recent and maybe more intense than what mumbai went through and my argument was that intolerance in initial stages is normal and not an anomaly i have to mention i dont live in mmr but more of outer suburbs of mumbai but i am pretty sure mumbai is probably the most tolerant city to both northies and southies in india today just in case and assuming youre from south of india that this is some northie talking down to you we dont think of ourselves as northie and the southern cities arent even close lmao you dont see posts like these every couple of days regarding mumbai do you have you ever in mumbai most people speak to strangers in hindi and nobody will beat you up if you cant speak or understand marathi let alone an outrage over a label on some product heck i buy some products that are labelled in urdu or maybe sindhi idk i already admitted about the hatred of maharashtria s towards upbiharis from my experience its more prevalent in pune than in mumbai and not as intense that itll make headlines more comedians shit on upbiharis than mumbaikars this wasnt a gotcha moment this is getting very us vs themery and anecdotal lets agree to disagree,1,2,1,South-India

really depends if youre south indian especially telugu maybe if youre from northnorth east you dont pick up anything easily because theres little to no linguistic overlap it doesnt just gradually improve randomly for people what youre talking about takes years of isolated environments to actually work out at all if you were airdropped in russia randomly you wouldnt just come out learning russian especially in your mid twenties when its much harder and considering youre there for only a temporary period of time like prepping for your exams tldr dissimilar cultures and languages dont just improve with time it requires much discipline and practice like a classroom,0,0,0,

english till phd is not imposition what is it then choice lol what made you take this choice english being more useful lets look into the history and break it down was english the socalled global language just 80 years back nope how did it become popular step 1 colonialism step 2 world war 1 step 3 world war 2 allied powers appearing victorious usa and ussr become the world super powers step 4 cold war and fall of soviet union united states of america becoming the sole world superpower controlling the world economic market through dollars controlling the cultural market with american pop what did you learn a simple latin language from the 17th century went on to become the global language you think this is a random occurrence america controlled the world strategically and smartly such that you were left with no other option but to learn their language for your survival career and employment and you term this as choice it was not your choice you were made to make this choice now you will still argue that english has more utility than hindi why should you learn hindi let me ask you something is it really about utility or is it about fear of losing your language if its purely from utility point of view then what if the central government decides to make the economic roadmap of our country such that hindi becomes more utilityfriendly will you then learn or will you protest bottom line you also know the reason i also know the reason that the real reason is fear of losing your native language for which let me tell you your language is already doomed and the killer is not hindi its english wait and watch go to the internet and see how english is killing african native languages and if you still feel english will not killreplace indic languages then youre eithrt too naive or delusional 7 8th generations from now half of your state population wouldnt even be speaking tamilkannada english already would have become the lingua franca,0,0,0,

god most of you dont even know how economies work immigration indeed is the reason behind largescale developments usa is usa because of the immigrants you want a breakdown of how this happens demography will change because people will migrate to fulfill the demand of workforce in a growing economy if you dont want the economic progress of south india you can simply ban the migration from other states and you will see the economy fall due to lack of workforce this will cause cause increase in expenses in salaries for industries due to high demand and low supply of talent which will eventually put pressure on profit margins of the company and they will be forced to move out of the state looking for more business friendly states for the sake of business now less industries and less workforce will lead to less income for the people and less tax income to the government which will make south indian economies worse than their north counterparts and this will force south indians migrate to more business friendly states in search of employment and this will again cause demography change issue due to migration of south indians there are so many natives kannadiga who happily became wealthy by renting business by pg business by selling their land at 10x prices due to the arrival of metro to curb traffic congestion caused due to large population coming from migration,0,0,0,

it is common and the more light skinned the group gets the less its called out is what ive seen i went to college in the 2000s and the indians in my school were mostly north indians of varying shades i might add and they were straight up racist about south indians and ill say i see this colorism within south indian groups as well for example im half malayalee and have heard mallus talk about color also a quarter tamil and that part of the family is brahmin so lots of comments about etc,1,2,1,South-India
im sl tamil and im dark even by tamil standards ive experienced a lot of weird or odd comments from north indians or pakistanis about how weird our names are how our hair looks i dont even know where this comes from straight up mocking our language and culture or even ignorant shit like saying were whitewashed for not knowing whatever latest bollywood star is all the rage right now even now south asian culture by default is north indianpakistani,1,2,1,South-India
as a gujarati yes but like also this applies to anyone that is nongujju in my family even other north indians my parents got the biggest beef with bengalis for whatever reason they are convinced about some black magic superstition lmao however my fam wont say anything to their faces directly and ofc will talk and be friends with them invite them over to as well in terms of colorism this happens with most south asians even with folks who are more dark my rather dark skinned grandmother is happy that i am lighter skinned for instance fucked up for sure,1,2,2,West Bengal
i grew up all over the middle east and yes south indians were looked down upon quite a bit in my social circles which were predominantly white republican american french north indian we were tagged conservative nerds with poor social skills not true my mom was quite the social butterfly but the stereotypes meant i was bullied a lot at school i know i still had it better i have paleish skin my little sister was more tanned than me and i know she probably had it worse she never complained though i sometimes feel ashamed that i took over that whole narrative with my loud whining cant help some residual judgment wariness round north indians especially fobs to this day sorry yall im trying,1,1,1,South-India

meh all indians are colorist but north indians have a special chip on their shoulder they for sure feel some type of way about muslims or christians whats weird was the punjabigujju guys i knew growing up tried to act black but also was hella racist to black ppl i never associated with those clowns overall my opinion on north indian people has over time been changed but that doesnt mean i dont dislike my north indian homies we all discuss these topics and realize that we as a person cannot change the entire perspective of our communities before you come for me i recognize that kerala the state my parents are from had one of the worst forms of casteism in the whole country but if kerala can change for the better then so can every other indian state,0,0,0,

wow as a non marathi person living in mumbai for more than 11 years now i was not aware of any strong negative stereotypes for marathi people if i were to build a stereotype id say slightly conservative pragmatic straightforward and minding their own business which is not such a bad thing as far as stereotypes go yes you may not become an ambani or adani thank god for that but mostly youll not resort to fraud as well,1,2,1,Maharastra
i actually feel that the reason that non marathi people have succeeded in mumbai is thx to the actual acceptance and non violent temperament of the marathi people also this thing of success being money is not marathi culture education is hugely valued and they are very progressive compared to most other communities they are very much live and let live quite shameful to earn your bread butter and pudding living here and thinking that poor people are a failure,1,1,1,Maharastra
full disclosure i am a marathi what ive noticed is that money is not the end all be all for the marathi community marathis may be csuite today but they still prefer living a simple life also vulgar displays of wealth are many a times looked down upon marathis are actually better educated than the communities mentioned in the post i will admit there is a resistance towards westernisation many people construe this to be non modern or non rich this is similar to south indian communities also the weddings are extremely simple and relatively short half of the ceremonies are conducted at home as a community were inward looking and extremely open to new ideas,0,0,0,

marathi manus in mumbai is sooo humble that over the generations they have started feeling that they are inferior to all these gujjus and marwaris around them what ive seen heard around me is marathi weddings are so boring marathi language is so harsh and doesnt sound nice marathi people call elders as tu the facts marathi people are conservative they dont like to show off their wealth we dont call all elders as tu and that doesnt mean we do not respect them some more facts in pune nashik and other cities of maharashtra too all these hardware marble ceramic and construction businesses are owned by jains marwaris gujratis but in these cities they dont dare to speak against marathis they speak decent marathi,1,2,1,Maharastra

not true if the people of ethnicity that you mentioned stopped all of a sudden the entire state would collapse these guys contribute to an insane amount of health you cant simply take the number of millionaire households as the basis of argument millionaire household could be anything not necessarily they have business for example it can simply be the rent of the property which translates to millions but people of these communities have businesses from hardcore sophisticated manufacturing to running kirana shops of course it goes without saying that maharashtrians are also equally good at it but the sheer amount of revenue generated by these communities not only in the state of maharashtra but in general is crazy the important thing to note is they work as a large family unit which gives them a lot of cushion and risk taking ability compared to any other community also the employment provided by them is speaks volume,0,0,0,

but tbh the tone of your post is much the same just in reverse no bro its just a response to constant ridicule and prejudice most marathis face in mumbai mera community important sabse paise wala baki sab ka gareeb this is what gujaratis and marwaris have been doing since ever they lack basic humility and manners hum ameer hum mahaan mumbai hum chalate he hum job dete he such a filthy and gross mentality to say these things i work in an mnc founded and run by americans but guess what no american has ever told me that we run your home and we give you job gujarati employer ka to roj ka he mistreat and humiliate their employees also their superiority complex and stupid gujju jain marwari only buildings and constant discrimination against marathis as if others are not humans such behaviour is so crude and uncivilised they wont be able to do these stunts in tamil nadu and karnataka bhai koi bhi millionaire household ya uhni ho all of them will follow the money that is the capitalist world we live in then why to act like they are doing a favor to anyone they are no better than others like they act,1,1,1,Maharastra

the truest is the daadagiri they play loud music whatever they want at any time of the day but for a single event on a single day police is called as soon as the clock hits 10 also marwaris and gujjus especially the jain ones hate nonvegetarian food which is why a certain repulsion to all such cultures in terms of close association exists the truth is that all communities are racist to some extent and op claiming maharashtranian moral superiority is just a testament to the upbringing that they have had and are now trying to inflict on others,1,2,1,Maharastra

not true if the people of ethnicity that you mentioned stopped all of a sudden the entire state would collapse these guys contribute to an insane amount of health that applies to everyone this country is interdependent so lets not act special and holier than thou if sikhs and marathas suddenly stopped army headcount would suddenly go half if biharis suddenly stopped all factories and government offices will stop running if mp up cg people suddenly stopped more than half of your grains are gone away you cant simply take the number of millionaire households as the basis of argument i can when the false narrative is being created that certain communities are richer than marathis this number proves otherwise leave alone marathis even tamilians and kannadigas are richer than these two communities by average wealth and number of rich people just a few people belonging to a particular caste of gj and rj doesnt change the fact that most of them are not rich not even middle class millionaire household could be anything not necessarily they have business most of the time its a business most of the time but people of these communities have businesses from hardcore sophisticated manufacturing to running kirana shops of course it goes without saying that maharashtrians are also equally good at it because you havent seen other communities and disregarded their contribution but the sheer amount of revenue generated by these communities not only in the state of maharashtra but in general is crazy every community has contributed to this country in their own way but nobody acts like aholes and harbours hatred against other communities like these people others contributions are not in vain,1,2,1,Maharastra

if you would have genuinely tried to understand my post instead of finding out ways in which you can insult and put down marathis everything would have made sense to you but just like every gujaratimarwari you came here just to show marathis as inferior meanwhile forgetting that gujaratis and marwaris themselves face high poverty rate low literacy rate and have very low hdi both rank 2234 now suddenly these metrics will be irrelevant to you lol read my post carefully you can remove mumbai pune nagpur nashik and other major cities from rich lists and maharashtra would still have more millionaire households than gujarat and rajasthan combined because a huge chunk of maharashtras wealth is in its rural areas its a major agricultural state and industrial state maharashtra has one of the most expensive lands in the country average price of land in maharashtra is 4 times that in gujarat every land is expensive in mh be it agricultural residential or industrial same applies to tn ka and ts and mh also has a lot of land so just owning land can make one ultra wealthy in mh land holding patterns of maharashtra are very different from north states allowing equalisation of wealth more than 34 of land in maharashtra is owned by maharashtrians and regarding your hurun lists its not gujarati or rajasthani that list is dominated by baniyas most baniyas come from gj and rj even in other cities youll see mostly baniyas on that list literally every city had many agarwals maharashtra never had a merchantbaniya caste that was historically involved in businesstrading and most of the wealth in that hurun rich list is inflated stock wealth its not even real just one report and adanis wealth crashed by more than 60 most of the gujjus marawadi owned companies have negligible free float and their stocks are pumped up if youll read that list most valuations wont even make sense to you and just because hurun hasnt documented the wealth of people in agriculture landowners royal families politicians etc doesnt mean they arent rich in fact they have more real and tangible wealth than your stock wealth marathis have the highest number of royal and noble families in india across the country gaikwad family owns most of vadodara and a good chunk of land in gujarat your list has people with 1000 crore net worth just a gold cannon owned by gaikwad is worth 2000 cr lol now go estimate wealths of scindia bhonsales holkars newalkars and tens of other maratha royal families and hundreds of other marathi noble families that are wealthy since centuries if anyone would have come with good intentions i would have even explained him more but you came here with wrong intentions just to insult and show marathis as inferior so nope maharashtrians pay the highest amount of gst and income tax in the country because population and income both are high its not rocket science its your gujju businessmen who dont pay tax there may not be any marathi currently whos as big as ambani but that doesnt mean our contribution to commerce is non existent and ofc youll find a lot of rich outsiders in maharashtra because most rich people want to reside in mumbai and pune just like most rich people from europe asia etc move to london nothing to do with marathi again yep according to you marathi have no contribution nothing its only gujjus marwadis who are mahaan and everyone else is useless idiots,1,2,1,"Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharastra"

bro at least try to be subtle about your disdain and derision of marathis what an embarrassing comment to make elitism and casteism at peak which century are you living in bro i study in an elite schoolthe likes of dais doon school etc and by extension i have friends in a lot of other elite schools indeed an elite school thats why youre so good in elitism in my batch of 150 about 70 are gujratis and marwaris and about half of them jains less than 5 ppl in the whole grade are marathis and im not exaggerating well then celebrate it obviously the most ideal environment for you i anyways read in pew research how despite being less than 1 population 72 people in jains friend circle are jains thats how they prefer it less than 5 ppl in the whole grade are marathis and im not exaggerating that must have sounded like music to your ears lol and most probably these kids get treated like shit by others a marathi girl posted her story some time ago that most of her classmates were rich gujaratis and marwaris from walkeshwar and how mercilessly she was bullied and ridiculed for being a marathi other kids too have bad experiences in gujarati dominated schools as a matter of fact most marathi kids purposely avoid enrolling in schools with majority gujju marwaris schools for this very reason and many marathi kids even the rich ones will tell you the same also if you really think that marathis are not rich and cant go to elite schools based on your observation in few schools that too in mumbai then you need to worry about your education because someone who reads pew and nhfs data ought to know better than that the proportion of rich marathis is actually as high as gujaratis and way way higher than rajasthanis even youd agree probably youve never interacted with them and gujjus jains marwaris only like to stay within themselves so obviously their friend circle is less likely to have others id agree that in mumbai marathis are not the richest people and the real reason of it is caste thats all i can say if you really wanna know i can explain you in dm not here but there are a lot of rich marathis in mumbai too who live in worli dadar parel bandra juhu mahalaxmi vile parle etc and its a very good proportion tbh its just that there are also poor marathis in mumbai so overall marathis dont look like the richest group but the number of rich and very rich marathis in maharashtra and even outside maharashtra is very high too in fact higher than gujaratis and rajasthanis as data backs it,0,0,0,

mumbai was a very important port city in british india people from all over the country were brought here as slaves or employees just like how many were taken to other british colonies like uganda and kenya which has a huge indian population as well most people simply continued living in these areas cz it was the only home they knew and eventually pulled their family members out of villages so they could live closer and together as india has a joint family system culture this coupled with the eventual collapse of certain economies like up and bihar forced many people to migrate to other states for work as their own gvts couldnt do the bare minimum and this continues to be a huge humanitarian crisis in those states as you have it it is the people closest to opportunities who make the most moolah and attract others to walk their walk much of what mumbai is today in terms of the opportunities it can give was inherited by maharashtrians by the british maharashtrians themselves then held the inertia by populating the bureaucracy and making sure that the state kept playing on its strength unfortunately they ignored infrastructure but did well elsewhere today it would be ignorant to claim that maharashtra alone is doing well while it does boast an impressive gdp cities like ahmedabad gurgaon are creating many millionaires and billionaires at a very fast rate they are building business hubs left right and centre especially gujarat and even the middle class tend to have a higher quality of life,1,2,1,Maharastra

lol this is a funny read the data by hurun first of all doesnt give district wise breakdown of the millionaires second you think if you remove pune nagpur nashik maharashtra would still have more millionaires so wheres the district breakdown and what makes you think that all these are marathi thats your assumption lol maharashtra also sees the highest farmer death rates and none of the major industries are owned by marathis lol more than 34th of land is owned by maharashtrian any source for this nonsense or came straight outta your ass and land cannot be converted in cash on a short basis most of these rural people dont have any cashflow just a land and youll start claiming they are dollar millionaires lol and hurun list is dominated by gujarati an ethnic identity and marwadi a caste identity and north indian banias sindhis parsi come in next again go through the list dont throw statements like an ignorant person the wealth of a person is tied to his stock valuations and adanis wealth did come back up see first of all you need to have great companies to even think about things like free float etc you are making assumptions and conspiracy theories at each point all companies are pumped lmao again speaking outta your arse few frauds mean nothing biggest wealth creators of the market have been gujarati and marwadi companies the biggest investors and traders are gujarati as i said hurun does whitedocumented wealth the marathis are not capable of competing to create a company or a big industry they hold lots of wealth in black lol the thakrey pawars are worth billions and worth more than marwadi or gujarati but they cannot show it officially you call this type of wealth more tangible you think other politicians dont have wealth lol royal families hold wealth through trusts and dont show up individually you think the royals of rajputana or gujarat dont have the same money its just mindblowing how naive you are you are not explaining anything you are making assumptions and basing your points on them again this gst randi rona its the headquarters man nothing else gujarati and marwadi dont pay tax its dominated by government psus marwari gujarati firms not a single marathi owned firm here and even individual tax payers are srk akshay kumar ab johars etc and not a marathi i mean sorry if the truth hurts your feelings lol,1,1,3,Maharastra
being born brought up here in mumbai i was still always closer to my gujarati roots more than to my marathi roots my father is a gujarati businessman if im asked to be unbiased as much as im a proud gujarati some of my relatives on my fathers side used to do these people do this these do that etc to my mother so yes i was happy to read this post but it will take me a little time to accept it as gujarati marathis concentrate more on stable jobs gujaratis tend to do business more there are exceptions always,0,0,0,
no data to support at this point but given that marathi whose native tongue is marathi are a majority they are also the most economically backward which often reflects on their caste system that is one nonpolitical reason why maratha demand reservation to ensure employment for community members this makes minority groups who are majorly welltodo look down upon them speaking from experience it is not uncommon at nariman point to see more office boys and helper staff being marathi than at midlevel positions this was common earlier and is changing now but clearly the mindset has not changed among some nonmarathi business class,1,2,2,Maharastra
firstly if you go ahead do simple math then the millionaire household per crore of the population with the data that you have presented would look like gujarat 4143 millionaire households per crore maharashtra 4480 millionaire households per crore maharashtra barring mumbai 3723 millionaire households per crore assuming population is 2cr rajasthan 2625 millionaire households per crore tamil nadu 4425 millionaire households per crore up 1500 millionaire households per crore karnataka 4714 millionaire households per crore west bengal 2100 millionaire households per crore gujarat does not seem to be doing badly know does it secondly i am reiterating that your data my friend is not official in any sense you do not even know what parameters were taken into account lastly my friend most of the gujaratis and marawaris are not like what you say they are it is incorrect to generalize communities based off of just some interactions right that way even i have had hostile interactions with some marathis which i can generalize and pin on your community but i will not do it because the bad interactions i have had do not reflect the thoughts of your entire community may you find the peace that youre looking for brother,0,0,0,

illiteracy is showing lol i know who marwaris are youre the one whos trying to obfuscate and please dont mention marwari and most educated in the same sentence theyre the least educated group in india also if youre talking only about banias then how is it surprising that majority of the rich businessmen are banias lol isnt that their historical occupation despite that brahmins kayastha reddy jaat are richer than baniyas overall lol so much for your bania arrogance and almost all of the banias come from rajasthan and gujarat so most banias are either gujarati or marwari hurun list mostly has business people so obviously business caste bania will dominate so what youre just trying to show off your caste and nothing else unlike marwaris marathis have succeeded in every aspect like social reform sciences arts sports education etc marwadi only have done dhanda there are 9 marathis who are bharat ratna meanwhile only 2 gujaratis and 0 marwaris have it lol,1,2,1,Rajasthan
you know nothing except and feeling superior because of those gujarati marwari billionaires as if you are one of them even though lots of marwarigujarati are living in poverty you are talking about capability of marathi people compare how many marathi activists were there that contributed to indian independence compared to gujaratimarwari compare how many bharatratna awardees marathi are to gujaratimarwari gujaratismarwaris have history of traditional businesses no caste in marathi does maratha is a warrior caste not business gujaratimarwari are the biggest monopolies we all know that you talk about black money we all know who holds the most black money in india and its definitely not thackereys or pawar as much i hate them despite marwarigujaratis being the biggest monopolies casteethnicity discriminating and unethical people there are several marathi in the lists your dumbass shares everywhere they are richer than you aint it maybe if you take your head outta those billionaire asses you might understand there are much more things to consider and marathis might not beat gujaratimarwari at being the most of the richest people but there are many other societal aspects where marathis have much more progress and contribution even the women in most of those billionaires have no rights i bet on that meanwhile the first female doctor of india is a marathi women can you imagine marwari women becoming doctor 50 years ago anandi joshi did it 1800s the biggest activists for women rights were also marathis and im talking hundred years ago marathis were more progressive about these things hundred years ago than most of marwaris are today,1,2,2,Gujarat

i agree to business thing of gujjus but it doesnt mean that marathis are not rich in fact ive tried to prove that through my post marathis in fact are wealthy along with tamilians and kannadigas tamilians and kannadigas are way more prosperous than gujaratis and rajasthanis contrary to the popular belief i do myself agree with the job and business thing in fact till relatively recently having a business was looked down upon among marathis people were reluctant to marry their girls to business owners but its changing very rapidly there are marathis who have excelled enormously in and outside india there are marathi billionaires in us like neha narkhede gururaj deshpande vivek ranadive etc in fact deshpande was the first indian american to become a billionaire way back in 1990 the present dean of harvard business school is a marathi a marathi was the ceo of citibank the present ceo of chanel is a kolhapuri woman recently mala gaonkar is has started the biggest hedge fund headed by a woman in the world business was the only field where marathis were not ahead because of the lack of bania caste that is absent in marathis most banias are gujjus or rajasthanis but marathis are catching up there too in other fields marathis have excelled enormously that they basically reached the very top 1 warriors chhatrapati shivaji bajirao peshwa rani lakshmibai rani durgavati 2 music lata mangeshkar one name is enough but also add asha bhosle anuradha paudwal 3 cricket sachin tendulkar rahul dravid zaheer khan 4 cinema dadasaheb phalke madhuri dixit salman khan deepika padukone she is a konkani though marathis have achieved greats heights in various fields marathis have the highest number of bharat ratna amongst all communities there are only 48 bharat ratna,1,2,1,"Karnataka, Maharastra, Gujarat, Rajasthan"

gujarat does not seem to be doing badly know does it obviously its not doing bad but its not also the highest like they claim gujju richest others poor we own mumbai you our labour all rich people are gujju marus and so on gujarat is not doing badly but like you beautifully did the math it clearly appears that karnataka and tamil nadu are significantly ahead of gujarat and i dont even need to speak about marwaris the data for rajasthan is right before you rajasthan is far behind but you dont see tamilians and kannadigas pomping themselves up and putting others down and non stop screaming that they are the richest they own the world they give employment the feed others yes they are really proud of their language and culture but thats about it they dont vulgar discussions of money this much despite being richer than these two groups you do not even know what parameters were taken into consideration bro i am not talking about tabloids here i referenced the reports of hurun and knight frank they are not some random gossip pages hurun extensively does research on wealth not only in india but across the world knight frank is one of the most reliable sources when it comes to research on real estate and wealth both these organizations have been making these reports since decades their data is reliable lastly my friend most of the gujaratis and marwaris are not like you say they are i really hope this becomes a reality some day i really do,1,2,2,Gujarat

1. Tamil Nadu has always been wary of the North having unfair influence in centre politics to their detriment. This has been evident in many political issues where the centre has taken stands that was opposite to the stand of the Tamil people. 2. Indias historical attempts to push hindi as a language and trying to give it a special status has always rubbed Tamil people the wrong way
3. There have been significant sc/st/dalit movements that blame north Indian version of brahmanism for the plight of the lower castes
4. Historically, Tamil Nadu has had more in common with the regions south of india than with the rest of India. 5. Indias stand against the Tamils of Sri Lanka was seen as a betrayal. Tamils in TN viewed the Sri Lankan Tamils as their brethren and therefore seeing Indian support against them caused a lot of resentment. 6. There has always been a group of people in Tamil Nadu who advocated that the centre will not fulfill their promises and will betray them and that they will be better off being separate. Hence the name of the state. Everytime the people encounter something that they believe is the centre trying to impose their views on the people of Tamil Nadu, this group becomes more and more vocal and influential.",1,2,3,Tamil Nadu

are you going to treat me differently depending on my answer unfortunately the answer to it is yes a marwari guy commented on a thread that how he receives extra discount on shops owned by marwaris just because of his caste and marwaris will always try to buy from marwaris he said that the whole idea is to give more business to a marwari so the money stays within the community he said that gujju marwari jains will mostly support each other and not marathis so basically for them the caste and ethnicity of person matters when choosing business partners employees etc,1,2,1,"Gujarat, Rajasthan"

there can be two cases in this situation 1 they own all of the flats in the society and ofc its all their choice then to whom they wanna give the flat to and etc 2 they might be having bad experiences or issues with some tenants of particular religion and hence the step tho i condemn it also i believe they have no right to do that legally and if that is so why does one not try to reach out to the higher authorities who can help in this case that might be the best solution in this case in my opinion also i have no clue about all this happening if there are any articles about all this stuff can you please dm me the link thanks,0,0,0,

1 they own all of the flats in the society and ofc its all their choice then to whom they wanna give the flat to and etc of course you will defend it its their choice which they make because of their prejudice and hatred against marathis they might be having bad experiences or issues with some tenants of particular religion and hence the step as if people from their own community have never done anyone any wrong and if that is so why does one not try to reach out to the higher authorities who can help in this case legal recourse in this case is extremely hard to get because its hard to prove that might be the best solution in this case in my opinion the best solution is to change the mentality to vehemently call out wrong things and prejudices like this instead of defending it also i have no clue about all this happening if there are any articles about all this stuff can you please dm me the link thanks sure just yesterday i saw an ad on facebook for a flat in marine drive which was only meant to be sold to gujaratis and marwaris,1,2,1,Maharastra

"Stayed in Bangalore from 2009 to 2014. Have a lot of great memories but faced the exact same kind of treatment from some of the locals. Learnt the language, used to carry a kannada mini-dictionary for years. Involved myself into their cultural activities, entertainment etc. But even then, even fucking then, I'd always find tons of locals who would treat me like shit. And I'm not even North Indian, I'm Bengali. Not just random locals like autowallas, shopkeepers, but even a lot of my acquaintances were constantly cribbing about how we 'outsiders' ruin everything. I get it, I'm not from here, but I tried my best to learn the language, even watched so many kannada films, tried to be polite and friendly, said sir/madam to shopkeepers, auto guys, always smiled and tried to ensure no one gets pissed at me. But nooooo, no matter how nice you are, they'd still curse at me. Almost got beaten up multiple times by locals due to absolutely no reason, just because I don't look like a kannadiga. Stealing jobs? Eating food? Wtf man those companies hired people from other parts of the country cuz we were just better skilled. No one stopped the Karnataka youth to not take up these jobs. It's the same logic behind people moving to Bombay and Delhi as well. Also, the IT boom happened due to the contribution of all these people who came to Bangalore to work. Bangalore is on the way to becoming a cosmopolitan city only because it is so diverse now. Oversaturation will never lead to a cultural revolution. Hell, I had local friends who hated on everyone, including people coming from TN, AP, Kerala etc. Why so much hate man?! Not to mention, the absolutely crap way I've heard locals speak about non-native women. The moral policing was some of the worst I've seen in India. It's heartbreaking since I do believe Karnataka and Bangalore are beautiful parts of our country. The food, the humour, the geography, weather, warmth is really special. It's the reason why I stayed in Bangalore for 5 years. But eventually I got so upset by getting treated like this in my own country that I left the city.",1,2,3,Karnataka

excellent analysis bullshit solution 1 first india cant have dual citizenship because a unlike the usa india has only a single constitution thus single citizenship b unlike the usa which is a federation of states india is a union of states without rights to succession so the union is fundamental not the state that is why the parliament can modify state boundaries according to their will 2 giving state citizenship and restricting the migration of people into the state goes against article 19 e which is a fundamental right given by the constitution to all its citizens correct solution we need a law specific to language discrimination and a la segregation and discrimination why act like scst for food discrimination you say because the underlying problem is not language but caste discrimination based on food choices these marwadis and gujratis and other castes consider nonveg impure and thus the disgust towards nonveg eating people most marathis are nonvegetarians except brahmins some obcs have shifted to pure veg diet to look more like upper castes google sanskritization but that doesnt change how these so called pure veg people look at these new pureveg people what we need is a specific law on discrimination based on food choices,0,0,0,

state citizenship is detrimental to national identity do you guys want that i mean it will make india something like a continent not a country it is possible to have this in india because maharashtra and i guess southern states would agree with this concept of state citizenship and we become something like the european union and the thing with the european union kind of setup is people can walk out of it like britain did with the european union so it will lead to the balkanization of india many people in tamil nadu karnataka and kerala would agree to part with india but the question is would maharashtra agree to part ways with the union of india too i mean kashmiris wanted to leave india since the independence but they had to face so much and yet today we are ready to support the concept of state citizenship leading to the balkanization of india,0,0,0,

we do not hate women at all people actually really value daughters especially nowadays however the main problem is we have an extreme honor culture which results in a lot of restriction on women such as having to be veiled and honor killings this is rarer in india but this type of culture is very present in pakistan for example im from a typical haryanvi jat family every women in my family or my extended family after my dadis generations is educated and those who live in cities work regular jobs and even in villages women have always historically worked alongside their family in fields compared to a lot of other places where women are restricted solely to housework also like you said girls from jat community especially from haryana are very overrepresented in things like sports academics etc compared to more progressive communities,1,3,1,Haryana

"People have a general misconception about the state of Rajasthan, India . This misconception is not just limited to the people living outside India but it’s quite a well known believe in the minds of fellow Indians too.They have depicted the image of Rajasthan as a state with:People use camel as a common transport.Rajasthan is full of desert and has no plain land.There is a huge water scarcity in each and every part of Rajasthan.People only eat heavy food i.e Daal , Baati , Churma.Every building in the pink city is pink.It is the hottest place in India.",1,2,1,Rajasthan

As Kerala is not much industrialised the inflow of other state people is less. It is only recently that people from Bengal, Assam etc started coming for construction works. So almost all the people we interact are Malayalis. Even the geography prevent people from mixing up. The presence of Western ghats. So any Malayali who is fluent in Hindi or Tamil is a star.

"This is gonna sound harsh but the truth is, Bihar has bought it on its own. It's the perception that has been created for them. People had it for UP too but Yogi changed the course.

Education also matters ..

"Hate against Biharis, though messed up, is not unfounded. Lack of literacy, Gunda giri and poor voting choices in the past led to people looking down on them. It's bad, but I can't say I blame them.The same can be said of Bengalis. The state has been in economic decline with no opportunities, yet people there have constantly voted for Mamta and TMC, and then proceed to cry about unfair treatment or rise in communal tensions supported by the very party they voted in, or move out.So yeah, while it's messed up, Bihar is like the guy who has no job and continually asks people for money, who you'd feel sorry for but avoid as much as possible.",1,3,1,Bihar
"A lot of people I know including me has this image of Bihari people intertwined with gutkha, mainly because most of my bihari friends used to spit gutkha all over the college, elevators, roads, trains. Many of them used to take bath only once a week in hot summer days.",1,3,1,Bihar

I didn't have any prejudice on Bihar as I have seen memes on every North Indian states. Until I stayed in Bihar for sometime and realised that the memes were absolutely true.

"People love flexing their superiority over others. I'm sorry bro for the experience you had. The thing is, for haryana/UP/Punjab, Bihar is a backward state, and thus, they mock them.

now a days it seems theres some race to spread as much hatred as possible at least on the internet since the pahadi people uttarakhand people especially dont actually have anything major to complain about they find us as a place to show their hatred but then again internet hatred is the most shallow form of hatred,1,1,1,Uttarakhand
in general most people from other states think were extremely rude backwards etc due to stereotypes from media and general misconceptions people who arent from our northwestern region even group us together with bihar up etc lol pahadis in particular just have bad experiences with unruly tourists combine this with our general negative reputation and they start to hate us i think its somewhat valid tbh people from haryana punjab etc are generally kind of loud and rowdy pahadi culture is the exact opposite from ours so it is probably kind of jarring when they get a ton of tourists from our area other states hate us for no real reason to be completely honest i wouldnt worry about that too much,1,2,1,Uttarakhand
they just consider those persons as haryanvi who fits their stereotypes i have also visited himachal and uttarakhand many times i never create any ruckus and behave perfectly they always say to me aap to haryana ke lagte hi nhi ho im be like alien jese thodi honge haryana wale acc to them those who drink a lot create ruckus behave agressively misogynist are haryanvis also they themselves are coming to delhi and chandigarh in unexpected numbers and many of them create same nuisance here,1,2,1,Haryana

ua uttarakhand people dont really hate any state its just that we pahadi people are having a bad impression about desis people from mainland india its totally based on our bad experiences with desi people when we were unfortunately in up we have seen how well we were treated we just wanted a separate state and on what cost we got it khatima golikand rampur tiraha golikand and total seven major open fires were ordered in 1994 on us unarmed crowd like jallianwala by that illiterate cm and what the up people did they rap our mothers and sisters they didnt thought of us even as indian similar case is with haryana punjab and bihar especially haryana and punjab they come to our state in fortuner thar car dont respect our culture many times weve found them drinking near the village and our bhumyal temples and if they are scolded they become voilent multiple times weve found haryanvi and punjabis in some kind of voilence or flirting cases in ua and as for up bihar they are not disciplined like getting fresh in open areas literally next to the national highway bridge in the morning spitting gutka etc anywhere and we dont love this behavior we are pahadi and we are peace and nature lovers jai bharat,1,2,1,Uttarakhand

i think every language that is close to hindi is made fun of and thought of as gawaar bihari jharkhandi bundelkhandi other languages of up languages from mp like rewadi chhattisgarhi surgujia etc you dont see this attitude towards other regional languages which are far enough removed from hindi like marathi bengali punjabi etc i dont know when and how this perception came to be so ingrained in the minds of almost all of india is it because the hindi heartland states up mp cg bihar jharkhand are the poorest and often a source of cheap labour to other states but i have never seen such attitude towards proper hindi but only towards these hindiadjacent regional languages probably because most poor people from our regions speak our regional languages or have its accent even while speaking hindi and for others its easy to look down on poor people and associate their languageaccent to gawaar ps now that i think about it i was surrounded by a lot of gujju people in my college and they all used to make fun of one particular gujju guy because his gujju dialect was more rural kathiawadi and even while speaking hindi his accent was visible the other gujjus considered themselves to be more posh and thought their gujarati sounded better and they didnt have any accent while speaking hindi the last part was true so even in these nongawaar regional languages they have made classifications probably bengalis marathis might also have something similar,0,0,0,

in this race for the glory of ultimate capitalism we have somewhere forgotten that english was only a means to communicate a medium that helps progress work which also does not automatically make the regional language chhattisgarhi in this case an inferior language the stigma is not even propogated by people not knowing the language the taboo has somehow come forth due to our societal obsession with money coz it affects how decent of a living one makes it clearly does not mean we should leave our cultural heritage behind and let capitalism take over it just means parents are insecure that their child might miss out on opportunities that they wouldve access to if they knew a certain amount of english it reflects in our teachers school but it comes from our own homes,0,0,0,

i think every language that is close to hindi is made fun of and thought of as gawaar in my understanding its because the official standard hindi was imposed upon these states and did not receive much opposition from the people as it was very similar to their mother tongue so most of the educated and wealthy class began speaking standardised hindi leaving the local language to be associated with villagers and the poor in states where the native language is very different from hindi the population as a whole was opposed to hindi imposition because it was so dissimilar from their mother tongue and would be tough to learn so all sections of society continued to speak the native language and it retained its status so even in these nongawaar regional languages they have made classifications probably bengalis marathis might also have something similar as a bengali this is 100 true,0,0,0,

note this is not for all of the following but some these are stereotypes and of course many regions have people that do not follow these negative stereotypes that i will mention so please do not accuse me of racism tamil brahmins think they are the best brahmins in the country and other brahmins are inferior they also tend to be deeply religious and wear a smug smile on their faces they have an obsession with sanskrit and keep telling me tamil is closer to sanskrit than hindi have some strange traditions like marrying 2nd and 1st cousins jains food fascists many of them want to spread their stupid food restrictions all over india and create communities where only jain food is allowed gujaratis extremely conservative and often hatefully so entrepreneurial but community feeling is too strong bordering on nepotism capitalist to the max and negative jewish stereotypes can be applied here marwaris can be loosely defined as champions of the baniya mentality often very crass entitled and okay with treating servants like trash very money minded with traderclass way of thinking on many issues condescending towards those who pursue higher education they have an attitude that they can just throw money and always get their way and are proud of this bengalis have a superiority complex talk loud and smoke nonstop speak in bengali even when other language speakers are nearby but this is something many hindi speakers do as well many are naxal sympathizers and have friendly fellow feelings with bangladeshis south indian generalization hard working but often very smug have a problem with complaining so much so that it becomes a slave like mentality of accepting all kinds of injustice keralites exempt from this part they stick with their culture and language in spite of northie attempts to homogenize them north indian generalization think themselves as the true india and the heartland and that all of the country should follow their culture and their religious traditions backwards attitudes towards women caste and society more conservative by north india i am including up bihar rajasthan gujarat haryana and mp often very antiintellectual and hateful of people outside their community sikhs seem like a nice bunch of people other than their occasional separatist tendencies north indian food south indian food maybe in the past the wealthy maharajas of north india created wonderful cuisine but south india was poorer for a time i do not know for sure but south indian food habits seem very different and they take pride in not living to eat they eat to live they spend less on food and have simple cuisine especially in kannada heartland,0,0,0,

kayasthas are a mixcaste deriving mostly from people from priestly brahmin and martial backgrounds kshatriya over time the kayasthas broke away from their parent castes and started practicing caste endogamy they were the scribes of medieval hindu empires all bureaucratic and administrative positions were a hegemony of the kayasthas as a consequence they got land grants and handsome purses even if their lineage was shudra they were now the richest and the most influential people in the kingdom the gupta dynasty even imported these scribes from various other empires to run their own with the advent of the mughals the kayasthas were the first to learn persian and attained the same status of lords ministers and governors in the empire same happened when the british conquered us from my research based on accounts of the elders eastern india was the origin of the kayasthas and as people from eastern india pala dynasty were invited to immigrate to other states other communities merged and took up the profession that explains the sizable population of kayasthas in bihar and bengal as hindu empires were concentrated in eastern india i am from bareilly in up and my family traces its origins from west of rajasthan to small fiefdoms probably on the edge of the ancient state of gandhara or pakistani punjab still trying to find more reliable sources for census and related surveys most people i know tick the kshatriya box typical last names are saxena srivastava nigam mathur and asthana source i belong to the kayastha community,0,0,0,

there are the four main castes you mentioned the varnas but they are very broad there are many sub caste groups along regional or interregional ines those sub castes categorize themselves into one of the four main caste groups ie a brahmin or vaishya caste most powerful castes that practice caste discrimination are seldom top castes on the varna system the yadav caste rules up practically it is obc but they still own large enough chunks of land run political sphere control many mafias and such etc where they are dominant caste system is less about prestige and more about what resources your caste controls and its population in a region,0,0,0,

changed their name to blend in this i feel is partially true i feel that many mallu parents name their kids english christian names instead of malayalam christian names because they want their kids to fit in the immigrant generation doesnt change their names but they do give their kids white names a lot of the english christian names have malayalam translations for example joseph is ousep matthew is matthai george is varghese isaac is eesaac etc all of my ancestors had mallu christian names but starting with my grandads generation people started giving their kids english christian names but christianity has strong roots in the mallu community the syriac christian community which i am a part of is one of the oldest christian communities in the world most of us didnt convert to christianity to fit in in america like bobby jindal or nikki haley,1,2,1,Kerala
very ignorant of them it irks me when some desis try to group malayali christians with the likes of bobby jindal and nikki haley who actually americanized their names and converted to christianity to blend in in the us most malayali christians ancestors were christian too as christianity has deep roots in kerala were not out here changing our names to joseph or mary or anne to blend in lol,1,1,1,Kerala

yes many malayali women in the us are nurses i think nursing was a career that was encouraged by the christian churches in kerala or something and i know a lot of malayali women came to the us when there was a nursing shortage not all malayali women in the us are nurses thoughmy mom and aunts for example are not nurses,1,1,1,Kerala
so i didnt realize mallus going into nursing was a stereotype until fairly later on in life either lol no one in my family was a nurse and i didnt grow up in a huge mallu community like the ones in chicago texas etc it was only after i started getting more acquainted with the malludesi community that i realized many mallus moms were nurses and they were surprised to learn that mine wasnt one thats when i realized how common it washow it was kind of a stereotype,0,0,0,
yeah nursing is a very popular profession among mallu moms in the us because thats how they were able to come to the us most of the mallu moms i know of that are nurses came in like the 70s amid the nursing shortage or in the early 2000s im sure some came between those time frames too i personally didnt realize it was a thing only because neither my mom nor my aunts are nurses,1,1,1,Kerala

its not as relevant today but the konkani speaking christian women of karnataka historically never confined women to the home like hindus and muslims traditionally did purdah and sexsegregation never had a strong history in christianity jesus and the samaritan woman in the bible is viewed as a condemnation of gender segregation so even though all the women in my moms village were highly religious and not modern never missing church having 7 kids cause birth control was a sin to them they never felt the same compulsion to stay in the home or hide from men so because of this when my mom was growing up christian women who made up like 10 of the population made up the majority of the female workforce in their area nurses teachers secretaries shop clerks etc they also pursued the most education were most likely to travel to cities to work etc but simply by entering the public sphere so frequently they gained an unearned reputation as being bossy and overconfident from men who were unused to seeing women outside the home the fact that these women willingly entered male dominated workplaces was enough to gain the promiscuous label these days though norms have changed to this stereotype is less prevalent but its not gone bollywood has a long history of depicting indianchristians as sexually promiscuous ex kuch kuch hota hai cocktail grand masti socha na tha ironically the flip side was that prior to 2000 some nonchristian employers preferred to hire christian women over hindumuslim ones under the assumption that they were inherently more intelligentcapable than other women which was probably due to have a longer experience of operating outside the home and in the workforce,1,1,1,Karnataka

my point was he was born with the name joseph he wasnt ramgopal came to the states converted to xtianity changed his name to joseph to blend in etc which even then is his freedom to do so my concern was how insular those folks are that they dont even really know their region of the world that the grew up in and became adults in before moving to the us then come to the us and spout ignorance with zero inclination to learn i think we all know desi adults who are megaresistant to learning anything,0,0,0,
i know some people whove actually changed their names back to the syriac versions or malayalam versions for example a guy my dad grew up with was named abraham jacob and changed his name to avraham chacko i know another family who came to canada as the mathew family and now theyre the mathai family my grandfather had the traditional house name fathers name given name naming order he changed the naming order for simplicity and to blend in but then as soon as he retired he changed it back i honestly think its a good idea you dont see other christian ethnic groups changing their names to english versions when hispanics come to the uscanada they dont usually change their name from diego to jacob or juan to john,0,0,0,
this i feel is partially true i feel that many mallu parents name their kids english christian names instead of malayalam christian names because they want their kids to fit in indian mallu here this is the common thing among kerala christians here too the old names you have mentioned have totally disappeared in my generation and christians are either mostly given traditional malluindian names like akhil rahul aswin malavika aishwarya etc or american sounding names like mathew justin sara angela etc,1,1,1,Kerala
its not just mally xtian parents in the us giving their names anglicised names im indian born and raise and my brother and i have anglicised first names even my mothers sisters borth from the 1940s to 1960s have anglo sounding names its been pretty common since the british era i guess,1,1,1,Kerala
the problem though is that these biblical names english or mallu are all translations and not the original names since both versions are basically the same name i think it makes far more sense to give the children the english version aside from the pronunciation issue its just practical because those kids will probably if at all familiarize themselves with the bible in english anyways mallu people are a small diaspora and the majority religion in north america is christianity unlike those of us who grew up hindu christian desis will share a lot of the same names as western christians anyways as a christian i feel like part of why our religion is so special is because it isnt tied to any ethnicity in particular its a global religion and one that transcends many ethnic and racial boundaries the bible has been translated numerous times into pretty much every language on earth and thus there are infinite variations of biblical names in fact even christ himself condemns ethnocentrism so what if they adopt the english version of their name it doesnt make them any less mallu it just means that they have a name from scripture that just so happens to fit in,1,1,1,Kerala

ohhh thats whyyy also isnt there a name for them idk i saw this pakistani girl use a name for it on tiktok,0,0,0,
i guess it depends on which group is your reference point and who you are comparing to i tend to compare telugu people to others like malayalis or marathis and feel like theres more of a cultural connection with tambrahms than others the communities you mentioned are nonvegetarians mostly however if you break them down by where they come from and if they come from andhrasouth they dont eat meat on festivals and weddings but telangana people do eat meat and drink alcohol in their weddings the music and dance forms are also close its all geography based for sure the groups you mentioned have differences from south brahmins but they all seem a bit homogeneous when you compare with groups from north or west,1,2,1,Telangana

ive heard this as well i believe the origins of this are rooted in agricultural differences north india and pakistan engage mainly in grain farming which is less labor intensive and can be done by individual families as a result its easy to confine women to the home since their labor is not needed and cooperation between neighbors for successful farming is not needed in bengal and south india rice farming dominated and that requires more labor and large scale cooperation to manage the water table as a result women were more involved in agriculture where they were outside the home interacting with their broader community including the men this also led to a stronger culture of community cooperation as that was needed to maintain the water table this may explain why south indian and bengali women had relatively more autonomous women which once again get misinterpreted by more gender unequal societies as promiscuous and overconfident similar trend found in china too this crosses religious lines too more bangladeshi muslim women in the workforce than north indian hindu women for example especially among the working classes,0,0,0,
i think your mum meant whitewestern girls when she was referring to christian girls despite the original commenters account which im not saying is false but afaik christians dont really have a reputation of being any less conservative than their hindumuslim counterparts where my parents are from in india infact my mum says they have a reputation of being more conservative especially in south india because they run convent schools which are super strict about uniforms and the dress codes,0,0,0,

i think to some extent race is the answer but in indian context race is not so simple especially when we consider northeast imagine kartik aryan playing the indian footballer from sikkim bhaichung bhutia that wont sit well but if any actor from northeast plays him even if the actor is not from sikkim i think it would be passable unless if people of sikkim or bhutia himself has any issues with that even a halfindian like ben kingsley playing mahatma gandhi is loved by all again the answer is not simple but the hypothetical case that i gave about karik aryan playing bhaichung bhutia or real example of priyanka chopra playing mary kom is certainly taking away the chances of representation in hollywood the trend is reversing nonwhite people are encouraged to play white characters examples are hamilton and the recent tragedy of macbeth so no right or wrong answer here just dont take away the chances of under represented people getting some roles,0,0,0,

you are complaining about hate for north india this sub reditt has several posts filled with hate for the people from bengaltamizh nadu and latest for kerala regarding the issue raised it is something to ponder over 1 plain fertile land is not an excuse for population explosion 2 the people in southern states have a reason to fear delimitation of seats in parliament may lead to loss of seats for these states as their population are below tfr the issue raised by them is correct cause indian govt wanted population to be controlled way back in 1970s and these states achieved those benchmarks but the states in northern plains did not 3 the whole situation is like these states are getting punished for achieving on the indicators 4 also the large scale migration of people isnt helping either its a human nature to worry about if your land witnesses large scale migrationssimilar to how the ultra nationalists are growing in europe post the entry of refugees even the states of assam and north east are skeptical about outsiders settling in their place 5 again your comment that tfr is decreasing in northern states is incomplete since tfr doesnt decrease overnight it takes decades even for a dmall change 6 population explosion should be a cause of concern because up22 crores nearly equal to pakistans population and bihar1310 crores is worrying since they have a huge population under poverty and population explosion will give rise to more poor people 7 india has overtaken china to become the most populated and our population will reach around 170 crores before it stabilises 8 in the future more automation will lead to lesser employment oppurtunities so what will we do with such a huge population 9 the central govt favouring of hindi over other languages doesnt help either and to make matters worse several dialects in the northern regions are combined together to show hindi as being majority when in reality people of one dialect may not even understand the other all of this is done to show a sheer majority 10 unemployed youth will give rise to more crimes another reason to take population explosion seriously 11 even the tax distribution based on population is nonsenseagreed that rich states should be contributing more but the questions raised are valid where are those tax money going if the conditions in these states are not improving at an appreciable rate 12 as for the panparag statement then people should go and see thecondition of railway stations before 10 years and now the large scale migration from northern states is visible in trains and railway stations getting covered in panstainesthe issue is so severe that despite being banned in kerala pan masalas are smuggled into the state by the migrants some habits must change if you move out of yourhome states 13 one gentleman in comment section was complaining about dravidianlanguage poitics but has no problem with the communal politics prevalent in north why,1,2,1,North-India

its not that different from the sub that must not be named all state subs are similar in predilection to that sub they misinterpret the constitution as stating india is a union of states when it is the indian state that subdivided itself into smaller administrative units democracy is about proportional representation the further division of seats makes sense on a democratic principle and i believe this revision is part of the basic structure of constitution so any party in the centre will be mandated to obey this dictate it is a fact that currently every voter of south has a vote which is disproportionately more powerful compared to others in the north this further division doesnt really change the monetary aspect as the state compensation is based om how much tax it provides to the center so on things that really matter this 843 seats is unimportant,0,0,0,

that would explain historical data but the fact is the south has been more successful in complying with population control measures also this shift in population means that the southern states has less political power than the north also the southern states contribute disproportionately to the national wealth but often gets second class treatment from the central government obviously they are gonna feel resentful,1,1,1,South-India

well this experience is pretty old one for me we were in school morning some assembly was going on and i think the principle of our school was delivering some speech i was probably in 5th or 6th and just a talk started between me and the guy in front of me and asked me kahase hai tu and i said up ka hu mai and he asked me if i was a baithya a word raj thakre and uddhav thakre probably made in their speech mentioning people of bihar and up and i didnt knew the meaning of the word itself neither knew its significance i was like matlab and then just the principle came and teachers asked us to be quiet i dont know this is much significant and i dont know that it was hate but even after 15 years i remember it and it is the only incident that remotely comes to mind as probably as hate for up and bihar,0,0,0,

im just saying that we have more similarities with them if compared to you guys we have nothing in common with you people so better just shut up your mouth even our languages like bhojpuri maithili odia bengali assamese have originated from magadhi prakrit unlike your languages and culturally too we are relatively more similar to east indians compares to you guys so better shut up your mouth you wannabe haryanvi haryanvis dont even give a damn to you guys fyi lol,1,1,1,Haryana
nah man i politely disagree with you in awadh we dont celebrate chhath at all migrants from purvanchal do that we also dont have jitiya we have ahoi original awadhis dont have teej either only purvanchalis who have migrated to lucknow celebrate that we have harchat instead diwali is our main festival since it originates in awadh diwali is also the main festival of western up poets of awadh are more in line with braj poets than bhojpuri poets way of talking is similar in eastern awadh and purvanchal but western awadh where lucknow is has a really distinct flavour from purvanchal with overtones of kannauji awadhs vocabulary matches more with western up persianised than eastern up sanskritised regarding history too for awadh its been a mix of west and east we were part of delhi sultanate and mughals as well as jaunpur sultanate nawabs were independent regarding food too we are actually more inclined with western up roti is the staple food here unlike rice in eastern up mughlai food is similar to awadhi food but then again you have a large number of people who migrated to lucknow from purvanchal but not from western up because western up people migrate to delhi indtead so there are more purvanchalis than western upites in lucknow genetics of awadh is more similar to eastern up than western up awadh is a really mixed bag unique in its own ways its neither eastern nor western,0,0,0,

wtf did i just read where did that wannabe haryanvi thing come from you do realise theres an entire place called delhi in between up and haryana right the kind of hindi spoken in western up is khari boli or the standard hindi thats used on news channels in newspapers and in bollywood flicks on the other hand haryanvis speak a dialect of hindi called haryanvi which is not a standard looks like you were sleeping during geography and language classes both or are those subjects simply too much for your low iq to handle first time im seeing a wannabe bengali ngl like not even bengalissmart and successful ones want to be associated with bengalis anymore and here you are pulling facts out of your ass to be passed as a bengali as rare as a turk trying to get passed as a pakistani because no turk with a double digit iq would ever do that,0,0,0,
i might be showing my own biases since i got family from the nepal border near purvanchal as well as hardoi and sitapur regarding hardoi and sitapur holi is bigger there due to the hirankashyap story being a folk tale from hardoi keep in mind awadh and purvanchal are also both part of the terai aka the indo nepal border the lumbini province of nepal is the awadhi speaking province and that shares chhath teej jitiya with the madesh province which is the bhojpuri province ahoi was something i know of due to my moms side which is from brajbhoomi not my dads side doesnt both purvanchal and awadh have ravidas kabir tulsidas as their main poets thats what i always saw at least not to mention buddha ram durgakali and shiva are common gods worshipped from the region in ancient times we were all known as kosala in the days of awadh we basically took up territory from hardoi to buxar food wise yes were extremely persianized no argument there granted we do eat rice but not nearly as often language wise yeah lucknow is extremely persianized but go to sitapur kheri hardoi bahraich areas youll see it with a little less persian and its similarities to bhojpuri will pop up more tharu is also a language spoken in kheri balrampur and northern awadh that is similar to bhojpuri because of this influence northern awadhi has a lotta similar stuff to bhojpuri,0,0,0,

im myself from awadhi speaking region of jaunpur where we dont celebrate chatt jutia etc but most of people generally think that we celebrate such festivals coz they consider jaunpur as a bhojpuri speaking region which is just partially true because the western part of jaunpur where i reside is an awadhi speaking region regarding food habits i would like to say that we prefer both rice and roti equally our eastern awadhis vocabulary has alot of words in common with bhojpuri but apart from that our languages grammar and speaking way is like totally different from bhojpuri ig that whole awadhi speaking regions main festival is diwali which isnt the case with the bhojpuri speaking people of our district but we do have one festival common with them which is khichadi and apart from that i dont think that our culture matches with either of them may be eastern awadhi has created a different place for itself which distincts it from both bhojpuri as well as western awadhi the funniest thing is that whenever we speak our language generally the western awadhi people think that we are speaking awadhi in a wrong way and when we try to converse with the gorakhpurias then even they make fun of us by pointing out that we are speaking bhojpuri in a wrong way,0,0,0,

he aint wrong tho from eastern up to bengal odisha is generally called eastern indoaryan culture and their languages are based on magadhi prakrit western up to punjabsindh is based on shuraseni prakrit so he was kinda wrong there to say western up are wannabe haryanvi and you are wrong for thinking bhojpuris and bengalis are not related somehow the things is during the end of british era and mostly after independence the bihari eastern up elites and politicians tried to move further away from eastern identity to become more close to hindi also awadhi is not a dialect but a ancient language of its own shri rama was awadhi king and krishna was brajvasi from braj region which is south west upmathura region anyone saying these languages are dialect of hindi is just an insult,0,0,0,
my man diwali literally originated in ayodhya thats like the conclusion of ramayana hardly any hindu wouldnt know that its really surprising that you dont know about diwali originating in awadh terai lies in rohilkhand bareillyrampurmoradabad region as well as in saharanpur bijnor side along with awadh and purvanchal terai runs throughout northern up ravidas tulsidas kabir were all from banaras but they are popular not only in awadh but throughout north india including western up haryana rajasthan mp delhi punjab but yes despite being from banaras they write in awadhi because awadhi has a richer literary history than bhojpuri braj and awadhi wer literary languages in those times buddha ram shiva and vishnu ram and krishna are all worshipped in awadh but kali not so much kali worship is prevelant in eastern up bihar bengal jharkhand orissa and assam religion wise too awadh has much more muslims than purvanchal western up has even more to be honest linguistically and culturally purvanchal aligns with eastern india bihar bengal orissa and awadh aligns more with northern india although since awadh is the southeastern portion of north india and purvanchal is the northwestern portion of eastern india therefore there are definitely overlaps,0,0,0,
agree with most of what you said and i dont mean to offend anyone but bhojpuriyas have a tendency to lay claim to areas that arent really bhojpuri for eg allahabad is completely awadhi speaking but since its on the border with bhojpuri speaking regions there has been plenty of migration to allahabad from bhojpuri region and now a lot of bhojpuriyaas claim that allahabad is bhojpuri speaking when its actually awadhi speaking in my opinion awadhis are really timid and mellow people and thats why purvanchalis think they can appropriate awadhi land and western upites think they can get away with disrespting awadhis,0,0,0,

exactly bhojpurias also have the audacity to say that even ayodhya is a bhojpuri speaking region which is like really funny coz the existence of awadhi is itself because of ayodhya both the purvanchalis and western upites are equally racist towards us but i guess that such things happen because we awadhites are like totally ignorant about our culture and language due to which our awadhi our awadhi culture got totally overshadowed by the culture of the mughals and all the other invaders the proof is that if youll search the word awadhi then youll get all the things related to mughals mughlai cuisine etc which are all the foreign to us in terms of relativity those who make fun of awadhi like western upitesand try to steal our land and culturelike bhojpurias have to know that the hanuman chalisa is itself in awadhi ramcharitmanas was written by tulsidas ji in awadhi language,1,2,1,Bihar

sorry for this bro when i was in bengaluru in the early parts of the prior decade there was this huge issue where muslims were targeting northeast indians as it got out of hand the police commissioner had to intervene it makes me sad that nice people are discriminated against attacked and harassed for very clear and predictable reasons and most cities do nothing about it an act of violence against certain minorities holds greater significance because they have media and politicians behind them but none of them care for other minorities ive heard anecdotally of course anecdotes arent facts that mumbai is considered safer than other places for northeast indians if thats true that makes me a little happier to be a mumbaikar if thats untrue its a matter of shame that us mumbaikars claim to be more civilized than people from delhi or other cities and yet do the same ultimately you and your community are the right judges cheers,0,0,0,

as a north indian i wasnt quite tuned into the casual racism against northeasterns but ever since i started dating someone from the northeast i notice it more and it absolutely exists most times it plays out in casual remarks and supposedly lighthearted comments but this is what accumulates into the feeling of being different or an outsider for someone it wouldnt hurt to check ourselves and make a more conscious effort to include the northeast in our national imagination,1,1,1,NorthEast-India

in my opinion people in tier 1 cities are soo disconnected with north east indians that the behaviour is like theyre some foreigners i had an arunachali classmate in my engineering that one person introduced our batch to soo many things we never knew hearing all those things about ne really made me travel to meghalaya assam and ap and the other 4 states are still on my list couldnt cover all on one single trip as i had to manage my work life balance i think people will really connect with ne when they actually visit those places and realise that people and their lifestyles are no different but similar to their own natives simple healthy living and people with pure hearts growing up we have seen soo much looks based mocking that we dont even notice we are saying something that isnt appropriate i think the majority dont even know where to draw the line i have huge and immense respect for anyone that hails from that region each one of you born there is a badass i think as more and more people will visit and connect with those regions all this racism will vanish but on the other hand my selfish heart doesnt want more tourists to visit those places as tourists and commercialization literally kill the soul of every beautiful place,0,0,0,

honestly dont see the problem manipuris are as racist as any other indian camp asking for special treatment because of some imagined past glory is a bit rich if youre offended because someone thinks youre chinese and not because you were misidentified what does that tell you about your mental posture towards chinese as humans,1,2,1,NorthEast-India

possible reasons i can think of is lack of connectivity in the past means you would seem like a foreigner to people here im sure as more people start travelling for work or studies it will become normalised but thats gonna take a decade or so another reason is rumours that northeast indians eat dogs and stuff i feel you and i really hate the racismdiscrimination that indians show for other indians example as a north indian when i was working in south india i was treated like a dog blatant favouritism towards locals and opposite treatment for my by my peers and boss as indians we should accept and treat others as one our lack of empathy is the reason why we were invaded and ruled over again and again and we will continue to be a third world country with third class citizens mentality because of it,0,0,0,

this is sad i am a delhite of punjabi origin i have also lived for many years in bangalore and mumbai i think with exposure and awareness this issue will go away in time i think indians from outside the northeast are not used to seeing people from the northeast and i guess that most of the northeasterners that they see are economically weaker or in hospitality of related industries therefore the bias hopefully we will get to see the change within a decade or so already we see the northeast being represented in movies if we have more and more prominent figures from the northeast that could also help people start seeing the northeasterners as our brothers and sisters and someone to be proud of,0,0,0,

thats the difference that indians need to discuss im sorry but i refuse to be defined as a nation that was simply given by britishers i dont want to be defined as the successor of british india we have a native historic genetic cultural identity one based before the british we arent just a random jigsaw puzzle made by the british if you want to be defined by your oppressor i dont know what to say,0,0,0,

you cant change history and you cant change reality its a fact and it would be better as early as you accept it modern indias political system is directly based on british system with some advancements current situation of pakistan and bangladesh are also based on historical circumstances developed by british you are free to not be defined by british though you dont need to identify with them at all you need to respect india which itself is a sovereign republic going on from 75 years you dont really need to identify india by british or other historical kings india itself is enough to define india,0,0,0,
desh chod de india k bahr chla ja,0,0,0,
thats genuinely such a spineless way to identify yourself just because the british did a bad job of defining us doesnt mean we shouldnt take the efforts to rectify ourselves quite frankly india should drop non indicdharmic societies like the north eastern tribal areas we should change from a parliamentary system and become a federal system that provides states with more autonomy pakistan and bangladesh are just as spineless as we are i respect india as bharat not india made by the british bharat is a dharmic indic society that has a unique cultural historic genetic linguistic identity we are all a mix of the indus harrapan gangetic asi and ani gene pools we have our own definition outside the british ignoring that proves that our country is a figment of our own imagination,0,0,0,
id go back to my first comment india is a republic a sovereign secular republic respect india you dont need to identify india either with british nor you need to do with any dharmic civilisation both are part of our history and in present day one is either to follow either the dharmic way or the western way of life north east is an integral part of modern india dont be antiindia,0,0,0,

marathi here north indians think were south indian while south indians think were north indian either way were kinda just observed as the other when i was younger some old lady called me an unwanted mutt,1,2,1,Maharastra
i dont dislike any ethnicity inherently but as a south indian ive noticed how many north indians feel like every indian should speak hindi and in a broader cultural sense as if they have the monopoly as to what being an indian even is that my experiences are secondary and not as indian as them ive been asked are you indian or madrasi as if they are different terms or as if ive ever been to madras ive been shamed and questioned for not being able to speak hindi you must learn why i can communicate to all the people worth talking to in my life in malayalam ive nothing against north indians but ive personally discrimination based on language from them more than i have from white people in south asian spaces ive spent a lot of my life assimilating to north indian culture even using the term desi is in a sense an assimilation for me its funny because ive had my culture put down because our movies are more unrealistic as a malayali this is untrue for my film industry our skin is darker our languages are different our culture is different on every bollywood realism post on reddit and youtube people would be like oh thats southern film theyre weird and worship their stars like crazy but with south indian films like rrr got international acclaim north indians were really jumping in on the bandwagon of southern film and positioning themselves more with southern cinema then they were like dont call rrr a telugu film call it an indian film hell after this priyanka even reminded everyone she has a south indian grandmother despite not even knowing the language rrr was shot in this microcosm kind of represents a lot of my experience as a malayali it seemed like my identity by some was only accepted as long as it made indians look good especially by westerners inherently i see south asians as my siblings whether youre indian pakistani bangladeshi nepali or sri lankan we share a broader culture despite being so different i hate it when that diversity is disrespected so it pains me to say that it really is the cultural chauvinism of many north indians ive encountered that really frustrates me,1,2,1,North-India
i find a certain type of abcd guy think suburban uppermiddle class pakistaninorth indian ones kind of annoying like theyre always trying to be cool and hip but it comes off as really try hard hasan minhaj has that vibe as much as i appreciate his stuff i cant watch him for too long before getting annoyed,0,0,0,
not really a fan of people who automatically assume someone has to be indian a hindiurdu speaker off the bat as someone who is tamil sri lankan kinda hard to fit in a lot of south asian spaces growing up people automatically assume i know hindi for some reason or reference a bunch of old bollywood films ive never seen and start referring to things in hindi words like bindi and chai i had no idea what those were growing up i knew pottu and theithani or paal tea though i usually just say things in english if i know they arent a tamil speaker so not sure why a lot of people dont do the same,0,0,0,
i had a punjabi aunty refuse to believe i was bengali because im tall,0,0,0,
as a sri lankan sinhalese most of my experiences with sri lankan tamils has been getting into arguments with them online regarding the ethnic conflict and civil war between our two groups as you can imagine its a pretty heated topic and ive had several tamils be very open and candid to me about their dislike for sinhalese people in general so i often wonder if sl tamils despise me for being sinhalese and associate me with their oppression and antitamil violence especially since im a sinhalese male this also goes for indian tamils from tamil nadu though for them they dont have a personal stake in the conflict to be fair i sort of hold the same bias for sinhalese that is i wonder does this person hate tamils i guess for sri lankans in general i wonder how much does this person hate the other group i also feel that certain aspects of mainstream tamil narrations of our conflict amount to caricatures that are built to defend their communitys dominant politics but arent necessarily truthful or the whole truth the tamils i encountered seemed to hold fundamentally blackandwhite sinhalese bad tamil good views but then again this is a bias of mine and i might be playing hardball,0,0,0,
not really biases so much as irritation at people not understanding that weve got 100s of ethnicities languages cultures and looks in the motherland even along ethnic lines you can look vastly different north indianspunjabispakistanis arent uniformly milkskinned gods and bengalissouth indians arent uniformly short and dark also a good number of northeast indians get shut out of conversations and organizations because they dont look indian im south indian and get tired of being told i need to learn hindi and watch bollywood until rrr i havent seen many diaspora speak kindly about south indian or other regional movie industries i also really hate that people get shut down for talking about what its like to be a religious minority in south asian countries eg being muslim in south india being hindu or christian in pakistan or bangladesh,0,0,0,
as a pakistani i wouldnt say im biased against north indians but i prefer working with south indians as opposed to north indians as based on my experience i find south indians less interested in the whole indianpakistani issue theyre more prone to helping you also i detest a bias against pashtun pathan people specifically in the uk anytime i tell someone im pashtun they automatically link me to afghanistan even though i have to remind them im a pakistani pashtun with no association or affiliation to afghanistan,0,0,0,
south indians have been kinda racist to me which sucks because im south indian my friends mom yelled at me for giving her a chicken nugget she said we are brahmin how could you then yelled at my mom i gave it to her because she asked and i was 7 i was new at school and i wanted a friend her daughter and i are still friends though my friends grandmother came to visit her she introduced me to her grandmother her grandmother asked me where my family was from and i told her we are tamils my mom is indian singaporean and my dad is sri lankan tamil she used a slur for tamils and didnt like tamils because of the kaveri river dispute which has nothing to do with me my best friends in middle school were south indians they would sorta throw tamils under the bus to make them selves look good to white people and north indians till an extent i really didnt like being tamil growing up because of them they stopped making fun of me after i hit puberty its funny they made fun of me and white women but did everything to please white men i was raised christian my friend told me that her mom thought my family were rice bags they were christian too which made this pretty appalling her family was so shady i dont think all south indians are racist but all of those experiences sorta made me feel a certain way like i was inferior i think i fucked up by being mean to them in high school,0,0,0,
as a punjabi muslim i hate when urdu speaking aunties lecture me about not speaking urdu properly even though i generally speak it better than their kids and i can actually read urdu i dont see any actual value in speaking urdu since its such a niche language globally im very ashamed of my inability to properly speak punjabi tbh,0,0,0,
telugu communities where im from are becoming the overwhelming majority theyre very cliquey and dont include the other indian subtypes in their community they brag a lot and are overly materialistic despite working run of the mill consulting jobs and they gossip beyond belief its gotten to the point where i am wary of and dont trust new telugu girls i meet because they have no interests except what lehenga to flex and who to put beneath them to feel superior this may be just my experience but they also dont meld well to american culture they show up late to things dont make reservations for restaurants even if its a huge dining party show up in wrinkled sarees sandals and bindis even in posh places bring crying kids to the library etc its a very extroverted culture with very high family values which i respect but it makes indians look bad at large,1,2,3,Telangana
not really different ethnicity but north indianhindi speaking people assuming other indians they meet also speak hindi and if they dont then they should learn like be serious,0,0,0,
i feel awful for saying this but i do sorta look down on the whole punjabi partyflex culture last summer i remember a sunday night where i had to get up at 6 am to go to work and some punjabi neighbors who lived several streets away from me were blasting music until 3 am one of the punjabi uncles in my neighborhood is constantly flexing on his instagram which i find kind of pathetic for a 50 year old,1,2,1,Punjab
not specific to any ethnic group but the cognitive dissonance of so many muslims i wouldnt be able to befriend a liberal muslim who believes things like white colonization is why islam and muslims are homophobic,0,0,0,
not ethnicities but i sideeye the abcds who are whitewashed but then do desi dances,0,0,0,
in general i dont have many but i see northerners as a little bit more arrogant excluding kashmiri and pahari types this is more addressed to like marathi pakistani and gujuratis i see southern indians and sri lankans as more humble im bangladeshi american with a little bit of pashtun in me i also see some pakistanis as wannabe arabs and thinking that because of who they are they are above the other desis and closer to arabs they are next door neighbors to afghan and iran but theyre still not arab and will never be arab on the internet i also see northern indians trying to claim other desi cultures as theirs and that is something that really irritates me were not you stay in your lane coexist dont conquer,1,2,1,North-India
as a punjabi i dont like the showsha of my people yall know exactly what i am talking about i saw lot of people complaining about north indians expecting everyone in india to speak hindi i just wanna say i dont care if you dont speak hindi i will still be your friend on a serious note all the south indian people ive met here in the us dont speak hindi i speak in english with them problem solved even one uncle ji at the gym straight up asked me telegu told him i was punjabi i still greet him whenever i see him or we have a small talk he is always friendly anyone who runs away from someone who doesnt speak their language needs to go to the nearest religious institution i hate bollywood movies nowadays does this count this might sound weird coming from me i live in a small state where we dont have a high indian population in fact most indians i know are working for big banks and making good money and are south indian they kind of have a clique its hard to describe but their events are usually white washed if that makes sense lot of show off of their wealth where their kids are going to university or what majors their kids are in maybe its the rich being rich they gossip amongst themselves and literally know everything about everyone maybe i am too poor to understand not really a bias but i am impressed with the gujjus people often call them stingy but all the ones i have met have been super helpful they definitely take care of people in their gujju community and they have definitely been great to me and my family,0,0,0,
as a nepali we dont exist to the vast majority of other south asian groups take a look at this sub and we have to be the least mentioned nationality here i have a pretty kashmiri pandit like complexion which id say about 1015 of nepal has but most of nepals stereotypcomees from its tibetian adjacent ethnic groups sherpas gurkha regiments etci and i often get told i dont look nepali even though us bahunchettri khas nepalis are about 40 of the population were relatively chiller than id say a good amount of south asian ethnic groups when it comes to dietary restrictions dating and so on though so im happy about that as for other south asian groups nothing too bad to say about any of them i find a few indian hindus couldnt tell from what part of india to be a little excessively religious but it isnt a bad thing per say alcohol is absolutely massive in our culture as all ethnic groupscastes drink even bahunsbrahmins and often heavily so didnt really cause an issue with my muslim pakistani and bengali friends but thats because they were from liberal families it would def preclude building relations with more pious muslim south asians thats for sure,0,0,0,

they dont even know what paindu means its a punjabi insult for punjabis of a village background they learned the word and use it for all punjabis even though punjab in pak has huge cities like lahore rawalpindi islamabad etc it might be because a number of poorer punjabi people especially from saraiki speaking south punjab move to karachi then they base their perceptions on those people selection bias,0,0,0,

i have a really terrible view of jatjatt culture i have read so many news articles and also insider experiences and it seems to me to be a very violently misogynistic culture and really insular as well with an emphasis on violence when i was doing the arranged marriage rounds i turned down any offer of interest from a jatt which was hard since many british desis are jatts,1,3,2,Haryana
ive heard from pakistani friends that hyrdos are pretentious and some friends have had problems with them and their families because the hyrdo parents dont want their kids intermarrying with people from across the border or pretty much anyone that isnt hyderabadi or white ive also met at least 1 super pretentious hyrdo but all the rest were super kind and down to earth,0,0,0,

my cousins theyve told some og shit that happens in that state punjabis might act like hoods but theyre nothing compared to the guys from bihar,1,2,1,Punjab
my parents are not angry but they did warn me against punjabi men shrug ive always been taught not to judge people on stereotypes though my mother is definitely the more sheltered of the two she was raised in an orthodox family oh and i forgot on last thing the stereotype that punjabisgujjussindhis are obese particularly the men because of all the ghee and because their moms overfeed them patriarchal culture etc,0,0,0,

same in australia its banter and very playful,0,0,0,
i gave that as an example but ive never personally heard anything specifically against gujratis maybe some mocking passes at gujjus but nothing really specific although there is some dislike towards north indians as a bloc although there definitely is a perception of weakened masculinity for north indians as you described short annoying etc,1,2,1,"Gujarat, North-India"
some aspects of the culture are pretty violent and pretty misogynistic its hypermasculine but i dont feel as if its thats as relevant today my cousins in india are landowning jatts in punjab itself and are among the most tame people i know i feel as if most jatts in modern times just flaunt it on their insta and twitter profiles and arent actually violent and such some of the greatest intellectuals in punjab were jatts as well so one cant always generalize it is a much different culture than typical desis that ill give but i always believe as one of my core ideals that you treat people as individuals culture is generalization but each persons worldview will ultimately be unique and its worth getting to know that individual over generalizing its something i realized after i had a prejudice against south and north indians for ridiculing me a lot in middle school but made a lot of friends from those demographics in high school that were awesome people,1,3,2,"Haryana, Punjab"
lol why am i not surprised its largely unusual cause ive seen some very hyderabadi folks involved with pakistanis in terms of marriages including my family my brotherinlaws okay more like my really close cousins husband but whatever are central indian and pakistani not to mention im such a sucker for pakistanis kudiyaan ugh the fact of the matter is that unless you live in a hyderabadi hub such as chicago youre gonna have plenty of pakistani friends as a hyderabadi same goes for me we get along well but there is no denying that the differences are noticeable too language dialect and food are visible and my general upbringing differs from them like these people didnt grow up with limca and i didnt grow up with pakola but at the end of the day we do speak urdu share many general desi similarities and tend to be muslims which unites us quite well its up to the individual both parties how much they want those differences defining and separating them im quite nationalistic in many ways but i know how to get along with my pakistani brethren also a bit baffled at the hyderabadi or white comment usually in our tier list pakistanis are placed above whites lol,0,0,0,
not really they refer to ethnicities as well,0,0,0,
its the same reasoning as your parents ie baangals dont have any high culture and are gaaiyan country bumpkin eat stinky fish use excessive chillies in food and worst of all talk in a funny accent they want to visit bangladesh because they know its beautiful also they agree that bangladesh has better quality fabrics and handloom work in general is exceptional,0,0,0,
if you are specifically talking about the antimuslim rhetoric thats relatively rare among bengalis people like my father who are prejudiced against muslims are not found that often among educated bengali bhodrolok the antibaangal sentiment is justi dont know neighbourly tension eastern bengal has always been poorer in terms of land productivity due to flooding and frequent natural disasters so people from there often migrated to western bengal for work people in western bengal saw that as a threat and have lashed out from time to time this was before independence and partition since then having to accommodate a large refugee population like in 71 led to much resentment especially because west bengal suffered pretty immense economic losses and political instability trying to tackle the initial wave of refugees from bangladesh still overall west bengal and bangladesh are culturally much closer than the two punjabs on the other side of the country bengalis dont have the same gruesome memories of partition that punjabis on either side have and there was barely any bad blood among hindus and muslims even at the height of muslim leagues demand for partition,0,0,0,

within india people outside punjab dont think of punjabis when they think jats jats generally refer to hindispeaking punjabis around delhi who formed their own state and now consider themselves jat by ethnic group and haryanvi by language the terrifyingly misogynist and hypermaculine ideals are unfortunately very much part of the local culture the majority of honor killings caste panchayats and punitive rape news from india originate in jat lands surrounding delhi,0,0,0,
my friends cousins keep marrying white people so i assumed that pakistani and white are roughly in the same category but i know for a fact that they have problems with pakistanis because like i said some friends have had their relationshipsengagements broken off because of this,0,0,0,
just goes to show how ridiculous the stereotyping is one odd thing ive noticed though is as much as my family identifies as bangal they still have a sort of cultural cringe about their traditional dialects like my mom speaks in the kolkata dialect quite close to the standard written choltibhasha but if i speak like a bangal for effect im met with dont talk like a bangladeshi i honestly dont see what the big deal is there isnt any inherently better dialect and there is such a wide body of songs in the bangal dialects but it is true that bangladesh has wonderful textiles and traditional handloom work like jamdani id like to visit there but it seems no one else in my family has any interest to go there,0,0,0,
finally a fellow idli hater but dosa lover,0,0,0,
lol no actually but i bet it would be so bad hed run away,0,0,0,
no i understand i just wanted to emphasize that i have always learned not to stereotype but still parents are human and they can make jokes based on stereotypes,0,0,0,
shrug were talking stereotypes arent we anecdotally almost all of the gujjus i know are fat in fact so are the sindhis only the punjabis are not funnily enough,0,0,0,
i think its pretty clear that im not an abcd,0,0,0,
maybe youre right im not too aware of the perceptions outside of india i do know that punjabi jatts consider themself different from the haryanvi jats pronounced jaats and spelled with one less t the culture is similar but has some differences jatt culture is huge in punjab tons of movies and music with some spin on the word jatt i usually try to avoid jattism or referencing it in real life but sometimes for social media captions i use captions of good songs and am forced to in a way lol,0,0,0,
lol that is interesting yeah i guess animosity can come to play ive had sour times with pakistanis but i know it certainly cant represent them all anyways i like to think im quite the antithesis to what many pakistanis in my area conjure up as indian cause where i live most indians here are gujjus or punjabis with the occasional south indian hindu when they see an indian muslim theyre confused lol its always amusing to see that my family has ranged from just about everything from people leaving the religion marrying white people and hindu who converted to marrying one of our cousins and being overly zealous with religion its all over the place lol but i do appreciate the diversity keeps the mind open edit if i had to make a baseless tier list itd be like hyderabadi muslimindian muslimpakistani muslimany other muslimwhites now thats stereotyping but yeah lol,0,0,0,
yeah of course its ridiculous regarding accents the funny thing is that there is no distinct eastwest divide in accents my father comes from malda in northern bengal and their accents sound hilarious to me my mothers family is from katwa in southwestern bengal and their accent is also distinct from kolkata posh bangladesh also has many different accents like jessore chittagong barishal sylhet etc but theres definitely a feeling that not talking in kolkata neutral makes you look illiterate even excessive poshness like light ts and rs as used by some young people is frowned upon very britishstyle accent discrimination,0,0,0,
its the texture and the taste its so tasteless and for some strange reason that always makes me gag,0,0,0,
yeah but thats the first ive heard of the gujju fat one my punjabi friends always go on about how gujaratis are stick thin apart from when they get older and get a bit of a belly,1,2,1,Gujarat
yeah jats used to refer to farmers in areas close to delhi both haryana and punjab and parts of up i think a lot of punjabis have made a subculture out of glorification of farmercred and thats what they mean by jatts jat pronounced jaat is now used to refer to specific ethnic groups,1,2,1,Punjab
at least youre honest,0,0,0,
yes like all languages theres a dialect continuum within bengali and to its neighbors the north bengal dialectsrangpurirajbangshi fade into the goalpariya dialects of assamese sylhet is transitional between the eastern dialects and upper assamese western dialects fade into maithili and the south western goes into oriya a standard written language for official contexts does serve a purpose but its sad how it often results in social discrimination between speakers,0,0,0,
the skinniest punjabis i know are brahmins and vegetarian maybe lack of meat has something to do with it,0,0,0,
to be fair i think its been considered a social ethnic groupcaste much like banjaras or baniye since time immemorial muhammad bin qasim notes that he faces resistance from punjabi and sindhi jatts however the haryanvi jaats eventually made their own empire and sikh jatts started to nationalize themselves jatt pride emerged after guru gobind singh created the khalsa primarily the sikh misls is what caused jatts to dominate the punjab politically although there were jatt kings like the brars ironically the khalsa was created to dissolve caste like jattbut it ended up uplifting jatts as a whole pushed them into further relevance and thus created this culture,0,0,0,
lol i try to be p all in all im quite hyderabadi and i could settle for a pakistani jaan i definitely would prefer a hyderabadi so they can get all my deccani urdu sayings but whos to say a pakistani cant learn over the years,0,0,0,
punjabi culture puts high value on bodybuilding i always laugh how im considered skinny among punjabi circles but buff among my generic desi circles,1,2,1,Punjab
i had no idea about the origin of the usage of jatt or jat thanks the whole thing about khalsa being created to dissolve caste but in the end uplifting jatts is so typical of the subcontinent caste is such an entrenched system of division in the society there that no religion even one that explicitly abhors casteism could trump it the whole idea of dividing people on the basis of profession and then making profession hereditary is so powerful you see that even in families which dont care about traditional caste but cant imagine their children choosing a profession different from their parents,0,0,0,

agreeing with all the comments here gujarati here and from scheduled caste the most ridiculous comments i get when someone comes to know about my caste and me being gujarati is do gujaratis have lower castes another gem is do you eat nonveg the upper caste hindu has so much hegemony in gujarat that every other gujarati community is just nonexistent on panindia level from the dialect to eating habits it is totally defined on terms of what the upper caste hindu gujarati does,1,2,1,Gujarat
gujjus are responsible for apartheid 20 in their state they want segregation and not mingling even in other states these gujjus will come buy property make houses people and try and bully people on what they should eat and what not to eat best example mumbai they control all the food stalls this very hard to find non veg food stalls fuck the vegetarian nazis,1,3,2,Gujarat
i lived in surat for 5 months if you think muslims in maharashtra are treated unfairly boy surat is at a different level,0,0,0,
hate is a better word than fear there is so much hate for uslims in gujarat i think ahmedabad is a city with the highest number of riots post independence it has to do with difference in culture gujarat politics is dominated by gujarati indus and ains and since they are vegetarians you find it difficult to find nonveg compared to other states they also harass nonveg food vendors bjp has used this divide to gain foothold since decades which has further increased the polarisation its a viscous cycle,0,0,0,
i am surprised no one has mentioned the gujarat riots of 2002 there always was a divide in the state but the then cm modis pogrom made it worse,0,0,0,
this is so funny because uc jain gujjus are such pos pain in the ass people that all other gujjus are erased me a shia khoja whose mother tongue is gujarati aint a gujju because these mofos have a monopoly on the gujarati identity too,1,2,1,Gujarat
as a gujarati i can confirm this happens,0,0,0,
more than being scared its the inherited inferiority complex in gujjus that makes them hate muzzies inferiority complex and fake masculinity unites all chaddis in the world ive met many gujjus till this day im yet to find a sensible one among them most of them are dumb af not wellread and have horrible communication skills my experience has taught me to stay at least a mile away from gujjus wherever i am,0,0,0,
ngl i cant rock with some of these comments which are borderline racism towards gujjus,0,0,0,
gujaratis since harappan times are mercantile community and we are the least confrontational people in india and being vegetarian doesnt help either throughout the history most of ruling dynasty of gujarat were major patrons of jainism so non violence and vegetarianism are deep rooted in guiarati culture so meat eating muslims are seen as some powerful entities capable of violence hence fear most of gujjus are even scared of going into muslim dominated areas fearing death lol 2 years ago when there was communal violence in khambhat and many houses were destroyed in fire my jain friend said that muslims must have done it because we hindus arent capable of violence because we are vegetarians this sentence basically sums up hindu muslim dynamics in gujarat hell even gujjus dont even like other hindus who are non vegetarians prime example is maharashtra where even marathis cant get house in gujju dominated socities gujjus in general dont like people from other states because weirdly gujjus have some sense of superiority and people from up bihar rajasthan maharashtra etc are seen as barbarians and uncivilized people running guajrat so gujjus hate muslims and even non gujjus we are pretty non discriminatory when it comes to discrimination,0,0,0,

i think its just more normalised in gujarat as compared to other states the open discrimination and ill treatment of minorities you also see fairly grisly anti dalit incidents in gujarat more often thanks to modi they returned to the good old days of bamanwad a few years before states like up and karnataka have,1,2,1,Gujarat
for real man even my state of up messed up as it is seems a little tame in comparison when it comes to hatred of muslims when you compare it to gujarat gujarat is absolutely nuts,0,0,0,
here is the thing gujarat muslims are also steeped in gujarati culture and language infact throughout gujarat they use the gujarati script and language and not the perso arabic script unless one is wearing some religious apparel you wont be able to tell who is a muslim in gujarat i guess extreme vegetarianism explains its to an extent bu not why even gujarati rajputs dalits and adivasis have also adopted the virulent islamophobia if you talk to some random gujju hindus or jains they will talk abt muslims as if the latter are some apex warriors and 1 muslim can probably take down 10 hindus in a fight and therefore disproportionate measures against muslims are needed is it a sense of emasculation and chronic low t not trolling,0,0,0,

well because violence in mainland gujarat are always politically motivated and there werent any such political angle in rest of the gujarat also what ive observed that hindu muslim communities are knit closely across religious lines and share the tradition of pir and bhakti also in the rest of the gujarat most of the muslims dont share strong economic ties with hindus muslims mostly have their separate areas in the city and they are mostly alienated from the rest of the communities also eastern gujarat belt from ahmedabad to surat has high percentage of muslim population compared to the rest of the gujarat,0,0,0,

this entire thread is an attempt at gaslighting gujaratis into believing that the entire history culture and traditions are crass op presents no credible evidence just a routine rage bait and apologist start apologising while mods sleep at this blatant attempt at bigotry op wants to project his insecurities as an attitude towards the entire gujarati community i am surprised but not shocked that randians are the first as always to attack the gujarati community by putting stereotypical labels i dont see any positive coming out of this thread since kiyotaka supports such hateful comments and never bans or locks any such threads,0,0,0,

gujaratis have been loved by all communities we have been the butt of all jokes on tv coz we can laugh at ourselves and yet our culture enjoys being displayed and shared on national programs the current issue our whole nation is facing is the fact that politicians have found it easy to divide us to get votes every political party in state level elections have had an aspect of language and culture ours is the best and people from other states are corrupting it this is an easy thing to sell and get votes but inherently divides the people of india and spreads hate amongst fellow indians i have had so many friends from outside gujarat who have loved staying here and would come back and settle in a heartbeat because of the people and their warmth hopefully the people see through this politics and the narrative changes but until then we can continue to be friendly to other people and hope they do the same,1,2,1,Gujarat

when i was in college there were literally just two book stores in ahmedabad worth anything and they were barely subsisting because people in ahmedabad simply did not read the same seems to be true today too very few people seem to read so topics of conversation are also limited to money business politics and the dangers we face from other religions no one has any idea about anything outside of these topics so yeah if people dont talk to a gujarati maybe its because a gujarati doesnt have much to contribute to a conversation,1,2,1,Gujarat
this has nothing to do with gujarati culture or the people if you are getting neglected then its entirely on you people of gujarat go out of their way to accommodate people from outside the hate for gujarat its people its culture and its development and progress is all due to political reasons if you say youre from gujarat and act smack then its on you not on the culture wait till op goes south,0,0,0,

fantastic comparison to punjabis that is truly interesting to me i can guarantee a gujarati studying in punjab and loudly expressing his forced veg and prohibition culture and distaste for other cultures will get brutally fucking trolled open challenge try it post in any sikh sub about how much punjabis and gujaratis have in common let me know how much love you receive anyway let me highlight the key difference between punjabis and gujjus while punjab is majority vegetarian theyre not fucking fascist supporters and anybody who eats meat can easily do so in punjab meanwhile if i want alcohol in gujarat i have to stay in a 5star hotel because in keeping with gujju culture wealthier people are allowed to circumvent the law ive met lots of gujjus abroad etc but for example the first time i visited gujarat for my elder cousin brothers wedding my girlfriend sent me a book as a gift because she herself was gujju and was glad i was visiting her home state my own elder cousin hid the package from me until he could snitch on me having a girlfriend to my own parents and tell them girlfriends are sending him packages at our house luckily my parents are not gujju btw i love meeting gujjus on travel expeditions internationally because they bring their theplas etc and are very social and share them but stop supporting fascism please edit thanks for the downvoted confirming the logic on this sub gujjus be like we are like jews because bidnass but we literally have the lowest representation in the indian army on account of we can never pass the physicals we are like punjabis because influential community but again even looking at a shaatarweapon makes us shit our pants and break into a unisexual dance style involving sticks also gujjus statesponsored oppression is what we got were tough when its 100 against 1 money doesnt buy class homies,0,0,0,

no one knows telugu stereotypes like telugu parents here are some that mine have said 1 cunning with money a lot of telugu people are really into making money through various means business properties investments etc for an easy example take look at the craploads of money andhra politicians and tollywood celebrities have in comparison to the amount of money that they actually make from their jobsmovies a lot of family drama fights with relatives tend to happen over property back home too 2 education theres been a recent for the past 23 decades surge in getting an education in andhra because back when we were nearly 100 agrarian education was one of the few ways for usour parents to get higher paying jobs shoutout to sri chaitanya and narayana for boosting this to new realms 3 pacchadi spices especially red chillies 4 the diaspora theres a surprisingly large number of telugu people in the useuropeaustralia considering that the literacy rates in andhra started rising only recently a lot of people migrated very recently compared to other groups in india 5 not knowing telugu ok this is a super controversial one in recent years especially in andhra it seems like a lot of adults dont think that teaching telugu to younger generations is a priority in the way that other people from other states might theres a sense of telugu is dying because people dont learn telugu at all or only learn conversational telugu so they dont actually understand academicwritten telugu 6 movies were all obsessed with movies a lot but another side to this is that theres a lot of casteism in the way that telugu people watch movies for example i know this one family that will watch any movie made by the chiranjeevi family in the theaters they live in the uk so actually finding the movies in theaters near them isnt that easy but they try every single time 7 clothes jewellery yall have seen your moms and grandmas saree and gold collections you already know what im talking about disclaimer these are things i heard from my parentsother adults in the fam i dont particularly believe in or endorse these stereotypes im just trying to answer ops question,1,2,5,Telangana

bihari people i met are open hearted and outspoken so i love them it is just that people in india dont know how to respect a person regardless of their wealth the concept of dignity of labour doesnt exist so work hard and get rich and please dont avoid where are you from kind of questions dont let this hatred kill your self worth i faced other kind of hatred too so now i proudly wear it and behave as if it doesnt exist it helps in not internalising that hatred and keeping your slef worth intact be strong brother,1,2,1,Bihar
this answer is coming from personal experience in bangalore i have friends from bihar working in really good positions they are amazing people and i respect them this is probably 5 of bihari population in bangalore the rest 95 are labourers who are just chapris they eve tease women get drunk and create issues and what not ive personally dragged bihari and najafgarh chapris to police stations the 95 of chapris make us lose respect for the entire state sorry man,1,2,1,Bihar
from what ive seenits not about biharis its about chaapris who cause nuisance and they may or may not be from bihar but it is sad that whatever they do all the blaming is done in the name of biharis people have this prejudiced view that all such degenerates are from bihar but its soo not true,1,2,1,Bihar
bihari hate is acceptable and justified as long as indians especially right wingers can justify muslim hate if muslims can be called out for spreading terrorism being backwards violent soo can biharis for being filthy dirty uncivilized and leeching on rest of the countries tax money im personally against this hate towards both the groups although certain reforms must be suggested for them to bring in their groups structure my point however is that biharis are not the only one exclusive to hatred all over india and that you need to identify the source of that hatred and try to fix it,1,2,1,Bihar
bihar has very high fertility rate in general people dislike communities with high fertility rate nobody group wants to get outbreeded by another group,1,2,2,Bihar
i have mad respect for regular middle class people from bihar i grew up in a metro city so it was one type of challenge for me to get into a top college most of my friends were chilled shehri dumbasses but my friends in college who were from bihar came from more adversity than i got imagine most of their friends were into gundagardi or politics or stuff like that i grew up in a city where my father could do business at a small scale and pay nothing as bribes maybe to mofucking greedy and corrupt excise officers at most but if i would have been raised in bihar he would have had to pay rangdaari to not be at the receiving end of a katta or me pulled into an omni while i walked back from school the worst that i could do would be to assume like some of my school friends that being raised in mumbai is giving me such a headstart in life that i neednt worry about anything and just chill the worst that bihari friends of mine could do would be to become a bahubalis right hand or the right hand of the right hand of a bahubali they are raised with the same ethics and values work hard dont lie dont hurt an innocent person etc after an age a bihari is as likely as a marathi or a kannadiga to be dishonest or shorttempered or insert any vice here cos not all people remember their parents lessons once they are adults you go to their home their mom would prepare tasty food for you just like your mom would do if it were the other way around their dad would discuss about career and stuff like it would happen at your home their accent and eating habits may be different but cant the same thing be said about someone in south india if viewed from the pov of a bihari there are bad elements in bihar sure more per 1000 people sure maybe but that doesnt you look at a bihari and pass judgment and assume that this middle class honest dude is a gunda based on his surname or his accent as migrants they work very hard to make a few bucks in the city they live in like one of the comments said people love a punching bag sometimes muslims are a punching bag sometimes lower castes are sometimes kps are likewise some people have made biharis were easy targets shiv sena of the 90s would target muslims and biharis among others i liked balasahebs thinking on a lot of topics with time they toned down how they thought about muslims shayad himmat khatam ho gayi but biharis remained soft targets its very easy to beat up bihari auto drivers in mumbai because they come in big numbers and take jobs away go to mumbra kurla and do that to ms see what happens its easy to hate or target poor people are defenceless thats also sadly the case with folks from the northeast,1,3,1,Bihar

this is gonna sound harsh but the truth is bihar has bought it on its own its the perception that has been created for them people had it for up too but yogi changed the course when you hear about bihar you think illiterate people unhygienic not safe for women gunda raaj migrants etc and the fact that there are a hell lot of migrants from bihar traveling to other states for menial jobs has created this persona,1,2,1,Bihar
bihar based on statistics is on the lower side in socio economic status its very easy to bully someone who is in the lower part of society theyre not in power to do anything against i have seen people treated badly to people from orissa and bihar in my state they are treating them as animals its very,1,2,1,Bihar
because biharis dont try to change their leaders even after the shit fest of mismanagement and corruption you cant help those who dont want to help themselves,1,2,1,Bihar
so the points like underdevelopment unemployment and poverty have been raised here now let me ask biharis here what are you guys doing to change things who has kept the yadav family relevant when they are the biggest threat to the development of bihar when are you guys going to clean up the mess of the education sector a friends husband is from bihar one of his sisterinlaw is a teacher barely goes to school but collects full pay whats being done to curb the bahubali culture when are you guys going to stop voting on purely caste lines this is the image of bihar we nonbiharis get what are biharis doing to change that image,1,2,1,Bihar
i never really hated biharis just dont let these stuff get to u man,0,0,0,
many biharis seek education and jobs outside bihar the rest of indians assume there is nothing in bihar but biharis are no different to people from any other state bihar has had some corrupt and dumb politicians adding to the poor image of bihar in my opinion biharis are very warm hearted persons and will do anything for their friends,1,3,2,Bihar
kabhi bihari mat bol diyo galti se bhikhari fir bhi theek hai bc culture mein rooted h even im guilty as soon as i read this i started laughing uncontrollably in the end bihar needs to become a state that nobody can laugh at to turn its image around bihar has the power and capability aise ban jaao logon ki aukaat na ho kucch bolne ki,1,2,1,Bihar
that being said i hope you dont develop inferiority complex for your origin i am a bengali and also i get targeted by people calling me bangladeshi and all sorts of bad things etc while in past bengalis contributed so much to the country and are still putting on the hardwork thats why when i come across these sorts of verbal assaults i stand proud to my origins and neglect the derogatory comments i hope you also do and feel the same about your origins,1,3,2,West Bengal
be proud of your state brother bihar has one of the most diverse and patriotic population in india and yes the achievements you mentioned too its just that in recent history 200 years bihar has been degraded of its glory thanks to a combined effort by birtish government indian government freight policy and bihars own government the education system is really really flawed lawlessness is there and while states like odisha which was once as poor as bihar in terms of poverty has developed well in the past 20 years bihar has hardly changed due to poor governance growing up i never had any stereotypes against bihar my teacher was from bihar and he was the most parotic disciplined chad type guy in the whole school his anecdotes were fun and had an overall energetic and likeable personality so i had no bad image of bihar in my mind but when i got online on insta and now on reddit i saw the stereotypes you mentioned i guess it all comes down to a mixture of these factors 1 education system of bihar and problems in fair exams 2 constant emigration of bihari people to different states in search of better jobs 3 bihar governments own failures 4 bihars stats in various indexes 5 bihars population 6 and crime rate 7 casual racism hope things can change and bihar also develops with a good government soon,0,0,0,
they live in a sorry state of affairs no party or neta in bihar wants to develop it they are busy filling their own pockets as a result a lot of them migrate to other states work in menial blue collared jobs and we all know that poorer folks arent exactly treated nice universally personal reason i hate that place is because once bihar used to be the powerhouse of this country mauryans ruled all the way till afghanistan sitting from patna now the people are wasting their potential and have reduced their glorious state to shambles up is somewhat improving wish bihar followed its footsteps,1,2,1,Bihar
i was born in bihar now jharkhand into a south indian family we relocated to hyderabad when i was a toddler i honestly hated going to biharjharkhand when we used to go back for summer vacation people were smelly poor hygiene people would occupy sleeper coach without tickets dry tasteless food and on on and on my perspective changed completely when i read indias history especially after watching chanakya old one tv serial pataliputra was the worlds capital in education and learning when romans were still hunter gatherers takshashila buxur gaya baidhyanath so many places of importance india fell when the battle of buxur was lost what is identified as a monolithic bihar is very diverse theres the maghi maithili from maharaja janakas mithila nagari bhojpuri each with their own culture festivals and script these are more distinct from each other than andhra and telangana kannada and tulu for example i learned that one few families in government decades of poor administration being a border state all of these played important for continual poverty lack of opportunities education and consequent migration many biharis studied in bengaluru worked there why if only there were colleges in bihar people who dont know hate if only they knew what india is outside of their colony and galli they would treat fellow indians with respect you can look this up on youtube telangana cm called these migrant workers as partners in development that is something that needs to be inculcated top down if top politicians antagonize a group with words such as ek bihari sau bimari people will chant that education and awareness is important on a personal note i enjoy the simple litti choka puri halwa as much as sambar idly i look forward to going to the land that was once walked by devi sita sri ram kautilya kingdom of ashoka and that of buddha and baidhyanath biharis are as simple and welcoming as the people in rural chettinad or tu go or even perhaps more jai hind,1,3,2,"Bihar, Jharkhand"

the word bihari has now become more like a slur than just a domicile of a person from bihar it hurts as a bihari but i am glad i didnt faced such discrimination here in bangalore it could be because i live in a diverse society and in my school cbse most of the people were from bihar and up and other north indian states and then came the south indians,1,3,2,Bihar

you cannot justify racist slurs by saying that the victims brought it upon themselves it would be like saying slaves brought upon themselves to be enslaved while i agree that there are a multitude of socioeconomic cultural issues persisting in bihar it should also be seen as a point that biharis have become a threat because they are hardworking enough to migrate to other states get a job and work their asses off even if it is a menial manual labour job it still stands on better footage than a lot of business entrepreneurial takes which depend on scamming other people many a time not always also it should be noted that whichever issues youre mentioning is more or less present in a lot of other states pollution since you pointed unhygienic faridabad and a lot of places in up tops there not safe for women the crime capital of india is fairly the up haryana ncr belt casteism is very common in many states maharashtra up tn sexism is far more present in states like telangana i need not put examples to even prove this point and henceforth while it is obviously a personal choice and prejudice to hold any opinion for any part of the country the racist slurs really prove the insensitivity cruelty instead of a progressive inclusive and solutioncentric mindset,0,0,0,

but the people being harrassed and abused are the ones who moved out of bihar for better prospects if anger and abuse towards them is justified then racism being faced by indians across the western countries is also justified you cannot negate bullying and discrimination based on bad governance by political parties also bihar getting allocated high funds in comparison with other states is due to the fact that the industries which made the mega states rich were propelled by churning out raw materials from states like bihar all in all these issues cannot be solved by victim blaming it will create furthermore divide in an already troubled society,1,3,1,Bihar

lack of civic sense annoying behaviour when around others only forms of songs there are sual item songs objectifying etc but then you will also see civilised biharis that will shatter your stereotypes biharis with well cultured family well civilised but its always the annoying ones that represent the state this all is true but when you make fun its the developed biharis that get to hear all the stereotypes the actual culprits will never know and will continue to be annoying so there is no point making fun of biharis and up your making fun will not reach your actual target,0,0,0,

this is what i have observed with people of bihar region and somewhat with eastern up folks as well they unnecessarily do politics on trivial matters its like it is their habit to create wedges between peoplethis is what i have experienced not an assumptionthey see this as a form of entertainment and i absolutely hate such peoplesuch are the people responsible for toxic environments at your workplace as well as your social circle apart from one friend that i had in my college i have not seen any bihari not do such things,0,0,0,
large scale migration is one of the biggest factor most people who migrate from bihar are mostly poor and lack civic and cultural sense also they are not the most good looking people and pretty privilege is a reality then comes illegal boarding into the trains thats another issue with the biharis now talking about my personal experience i mostly travel by train and bus most bihari people i see are often chewing guthka and i hate that thing they would spit anywhere their hindi is not the hindi we used to so it sounds bad also another fact is they talk so loudly over the phones also living in slums and footpaths dont help to people talk good about them when most people from a particular community do things that people dont like it creates a stereotype against them i agree that most people in our country lack civic sense but they make it up elsewhere,1,2,1,Bihar
lets see they refuse to reduce breeding they mass migrate everywhere and lets be real no state likes bihari migrants extreme level of corruption in that state that sucks the developed states taxes dry but remains a shithole nevertheless no civic sense high crime rates delusional to think everyone is conspiring against them and theyre great causes huge strain on the countrys resources single handedly bringing india down on some metrics its gdp is 13rd of even up etc edit my comment is not about every individual bihari but on gross basis,1,1,1,Bihar

basically biharis are more indian then rest of indian in every aspect so rest of indians treat trm how they are treated by nonindians,1,2,1,Bihar
bihar was the center of indian thought centuries ago biharis played a prominent role during the struggle for independence even after independence bihar played a key role in politics jp narayan launched his movement for bihar bihar has had many prominent authors and poets for the last few decades bihar politics has turned increasingly casteist and that brings with it corruption and the desire for social groups to grab a larger share of the pot unfortunately there hasnt been the focus on increasing the size of the pot this has meant that bihar has been left behind so even though biharis make a large percentage of skilled migratory labor outside bihar bihar itself lacks opportunities for local employment,1,1,1,Bihar
i still remember this incident from my kota days so there was this rajashthani guy from mewar ig often he would boast and feel proud in insulting biharis and calling his hometown superior because apparently he came form warrior bhumi he use to say this now the point is 99 percent of biharis in my hostel were either obc or sc st with an exception let us call him x x so he was rajput one day this rajashthani started to tease and make x down by calling him bihari and other typical slang out of nowhere x started caste ranting so hard that our rajasthani bro felt down and complained to warden upon asking x he said if downplaying on the basis of birth place is justified then why not discriminate on basis of birth caste as both are not choosen that day he earned all of ur respectbtw the rajasthani was sc,1,2,1,"Rajasthan, Punjab"

yes but biharis conspicuously stand out in this regard in my personal experience which comes from several examples biharis are more likely to teach their children to lie and cheat and to shield them when they are caught biharis are more likely to adopt a kya kar lega attitude when they are pointed out that they are breaking rules biharis tend to judge the power of a person by their ability to break rules openly without being challenged this is how powerful people behave in bihar this is why average biharis too break rules to feel more powerful,1,2,1,Bihar

as a bihari we have to accept the fact that most of our population is falls under the poverty state is represented by majority of population not by 1020 of the population we belonging from city like patna and think that each and everything city district have same amount of money poverty in real is more terrible than it looks on paper we have to accept the fact and works towards making it better a day will come and all these stereotype will be gone,1,2,1,Bihar
in their eyes biharis are equal to labourers but the worst thing is their mentality towards the labour class is sick they dont treat them well they think labourers are filthy people in my college i had a very good of mine who is a gurjar and in their community they use bihari as a derogatory term similarly i got to know there are a few communities they call biharis as bhaiye just to mock them again why are they using these words it is because the majority of the biharis they meet are mostly laborers and labourers are poor economically backward and if economically backward then they dont deserve respect as per their pov i have lived in various cities and have met a good amount of people and every time i tell them im from bihar they always revert back by saying you dont look like a bihari i thought you were from xyz place and why did they assume this a i have a fair skin complexion b i can speak in english c im working in corporate rather than working as a laborer tldr for them bihari labourers poor who cant speak english dark complexion filthy people who dont deserve respect this is just my take on this if you feel there is something wrong we can discuss that,0,0,0,
recently i have seen the trend of up guys saying that bihari are majdur and poor and that was really funny man,1,2,1,Bihar
i think the worst thing that happened to us biharis is that we are at the bottom of our time on this planet when the electronic and other forms of media were slowly becoming influential the first glance they caught of us was negative and it stuck with us and then there were few issues of our own behaviour too and now people have no time to stick to something and actually learn stereotyping is easier compared to actually seeking the truth man,0,0,0,

i am not from himachal but my unpopular opinion overdevelopment causing increase in landslides narrative is exaggerated what is happening is that earlier when no roads over multi storied buildings were present there were landslides but no loss of public or private property eg a mountain side experiences landslide but only has trees and isolated kuccha huts it will not make the news but same mountain is highly built upon same landslide happens there is loss to public and private property and it becomes news and people talk about it some overdevelopment or rather transplanting building practices from the plains is causing problems to be more severe in some areas like shimla but other times it is just stupidity like building cafes and hotels beside a fast flowing mountain stream or river all rivers flood it is part of nature and especially in mountains it is dangerous other mountainous regions of the world have been built up and highly developed with high population density like the alps central iranian mountains region etc it just needs to be done keeping in mind local challenges and build using mountain specific techniques also making 4 lane roads is entirely feasible and required in some areas but it should be done as an elevated road like china does where mountains are prone to landslide it is more expensive but will not get blocked as often as mountain side cut roads that we make and therefore less costly in long run lastly natural disasters are not a message from mahadev about not following culture and other reasons some like to peddle it is combination of natural phenomenon and human unpreparednessshortsightedness primary responsibility is that of local administration that has allowed problems to balloon over the years and not tourists who have been made scapegoat by some people,0,0,0,

1 people in himachal are generally reserved so it takes time to build trust with strangers maybe you didnt make enough effort to fit in and to be trusted so you felt like people are selfish or you had a very bad luck that all you encountered were selfish bad people can be everywhere 2 rural areas is getting development but in wrong direction for sure lawless really 3 my grandfather ploughed the field at the age of 75 in scorching heat and i helped we both are men generally men work in fields and women take care of cattle 4 this tourism vala argument is so weak that every himachali laughs at it now yes it is a considerable amount definitely can impact the economy but bankrupt thats a bit of an overstatement no we arent offended its your opinion and opinions are mostly subjective since you didnt give any proof for objectivity so we dont mind,1,2,3,Himachal Pradesh

what is this whining about not being able to buy land in himachal the entitlement is crazy almost every himalayan state has land laws and there is a reason for it the land laws in the northeastern states are even more strict than in himachal so why dont you also talk to them about you not being able to buy land there you guys dont understand that these land laws were put in place considering the fragile geography of this region lahaul spiti and kinnaur are two of the biggest districts in himachal and even himachalis cant buy land there because those are tribal areas the population in these districts is also very low compared to other regions since the living conditions are so harsh you only want some vacation home which you can visit monthly or annually but you really cant live here for long there are still places in himachal that have 0 road access and places where it snows 6 months a year like pangi in chamba see the natural disasters that hit himachal in the past few months you think a place like that can sustain such a large population see uttarakhand for example they are a himalayan state that do not have land laws and they are now suffering due to it they too are demanding land laws now and stop saying these laws make you feel like you are outsiders you can freely visit himachal any time without needing visas so just quit this,0,0,0,
then himachal will cease to remain himachal it will be like every other city do you really feel that people will follow guidelines and not totally destroy the beautiful himachal,0,0,0,
i feel like this should jot be allowed see himachal is a stratigically important place moreover this rule exists so that their native populations and tribes dont go exitinct same thing happened in kashmir only people born in kashmir could buy land over there kashmiri muslims figured this out and started forcefully evacuating kashmiri hindus houses so that they would run away and eventually lose their kashmiri land ownership thus this is how they totally occupied all the area by killing hindus and now hindus cant even buy land in their own place for reference im a kashmiri hindu myself and i dont care about hurting anyones religious sentiment whats true is true 95 percent people in himachal pradesh are hindus and its due to this rule that this number is maintained otherwise everyone likes himachal and will come settle over there and slowly start occupying their hindus land and we will be forced ro displace again so this way no one neither hindus nor muslims or any other religious community can come and claim land over there,1,2,2,Jammu and Kashmir

dont get me wrong as i am from delhi but have lived all over india and some of the world delhi is not a place but a union of people with diverse tormented experiences historic delhi was always in the middle of war and unrest thats how we got the delhisultanate the original population of delhi were few from borders of haryana punjab chandigarhduh and up farming was the main practice and todays delhi was mostly a junglefarm 70 years ago british government used the unoccupied land of modern day delhi to run their rule and we got parliament so it mostly became a residence of government officials both working and retired due to immediate access to facilities the population expanded and the ncr term was coined by morden indian for og border area residents then the great indopak divide happened and the land was used to resettle the migrated population after independence delhi grew and grew with influence of being a capital and we got diversity in population food and different tone of hindi we are 46 million people living in delhi from oldesttooldtonewgeneration people with memories and urban legends of mughal invasion british raj and political barrel of democracy politically speaking i like to call delhi as the dumping ground of election manifestos i was born raised and ate chole bhature there i had classmates with stories from other side of borders and empathic sentiments of sikh riots i have seen burn cars in ditches and onside of roads back in 2000s and couldnt comprehend the fact why would someone burn such nice looking cars unfortunately i know the reason now call us crazy or stone headed but yeah we still have fetish for weekly haatsweekly bazaars on most crowded roads and the traffic for once in a week wont mind in a nutshell we are just a crazy bunch of people sala pura agrezi jhaardh gaya iss post mei dhang se like diya hai panga mat liyo,0,0,0,

man you really hate those immigrants lol har dusre comment me you manage to include them as a 2nd generation immigrant i can tell you all the stories my dadi used to tell me when we came from bahawlpur my dadi was in her early teens when she was married off to someone 10 years older than her and all of her family was killed except her elder sister she only came to know that her sister survived only after several years my dada had money to only buy some land and nothing else at the time he had to chose between old rajinder nagar and new rajinder nagar he didnt have enough money for new so he settled with old one other reason to choose old was the fact that it was already somewhat habitated and new was completely a forest fast forward to living in a jhuggi on that land they now had 67 kids and only 4 of them survived 3 boys and 1 girl money was scarce and my dadi had to resort to manual scavengingbeing a maid in day and sewing work at night so that she could provide her kids with some education you must be wondering wtf was my dada doing that my dadi had to stoop down as low as scavenging well he died when my father was a barely a teenager but it was still not enough so she had to make a sacrifice she gave away my father for adoption to his chacha dadas elder brother he had a vegetable stall and my father used to help him there so that rest of his siblings could get an education and they did my father is now a retired northern railways master craftsmanbasically labour focused on repairing trains because he was uneducated his most elder brother is also retired the youngest is still working in water commission pension department and their sister is dead theres more stuff to this but yeah i just wanted to give you an idea that not everyone got land for gift when they came here i know with the amount of hate you have for us people you would probably take this comment in a negative way but eh i dont care just wanted to let this off of my chest,0,0,0,

see this south india superiority bs comes from dravidanazis in tn and marxists from kerala both of whom dont give a shit for other people in south india or facts for that matter but just want to tear the country apart for their political agenda if you want to talk regionalism then western india maharashtra gujarat goa dd dnh is the economic cultural tourism and educational powerhouse of the entire subcontinent it is one of the richest regions in all of asia mumbais bmc has a budget more than the gdp of many countries rajkot municipal corporation has a budget greater than the karachi municipal corporation most of indias billionaires live in this region yet people from western india are the least likely to show off about all this because they dont have marxists and dravidanazis its not that they arent proud of their achievements they really are but they dont use it to belittle others even in telangana and karnataka nobody buys this northsouth rubbish and in fact there is tremendous suspicion and dislike for those antinational groups in kerala and tn not to mention a general dislike for tn entirely but thats a different matter andhra anyway is the bihar of the south and cant really say much,0,0,0,
most people dont really look at data or at what some political party says this perception that the south is more developed and rich comes from the everyday experiences of the people this perception mostly comes from looking at the sheer number of north indians who have to leave their homes and come to our states looking for better opportunities be it education or jobs you want to get some work done on your house the construction labourers carpenters granite workers painters etc are all migrants even in villages you have migrants from bihar or someplace working as farm laborers farm labour pays twice or even thrice as much in places like kerala than in their own state you go to some shop or restuarant in bengaluru most of the staff is from the north or north east its become so widespread that you can find them working in even small hotels bakeries and shops i have a relative whose entire business is importing contract labour from bengal chattisgarh odissa etc he gets some hundred people to work in industries like fish processing for exports etc houses them in a dorm and sends them back after their contract of 6 months or so is over this necessity of leaving your state and going out searching for opportunities is not really something we face at least here in karnataka people travel to other countries but not to other parts of the country with the exception of possibly mumbai during the times of my parentsgeneration a few years ago i had to shift to delhi for my work and it was strange in my family circles because no one had lived in delhi before i have family in most of the world from us europe middle east to australia but no one had ever lived north of mumbai within our own country,0,0,0,

i raised this exact point in tamilnadu and chennai that you guys are always tomtoming about how great we are only in comparison to up and bihar how about you compare to maharahstra and gujarat since you guys consider them north indians as well obviously i got lot of brick bats and convoluted responses my advise to nontamils is this do not take rchennai or rtamilnadu as represenative of tamil ppljust like you will not take rindia to be represenative of indians in general,1,2,1,Tamil Nadu
i have never looked at stats but the difference is quite clear when you actually walk the streets lol you bringing up delhi but its literally a city lmao bangalore has a literacy rate of 89chennai is 90 and tvm is 95 if youre talking about maharashtra then how is it not fair to bring up up bihar mp rajasthan jharkand how many of these north states have a better literacy than the south many people come south for work both skilled and unskilled its literally evident there are zero opportunities up north stop tryna bring up some goofy north south debate shit is literally living rent free in your head,0,0,0,

i am not convinced man literally half of the population in uttarakhand migrate to plains or other states for healthcare whereas in kerala this might not be the truth thus i dont get it how uttarakhand even comes just after kerala may be truth for delhi himanchal but uttarakhand far from the reality and coming to safe for women that might be true but soon thats going to change with locals migrating to other states in large numbers and influx of migrants from delhi up bihar and haryana with people from a particular religion group which generally have a tendency to make every place unsafe for others coming to uttarakhand and there is literally isnt any city in uttarakhand with good public transportation which again is better in kerala so i think whatever selective viewpoint you are trying to present in reality southern states fare better than their northern counterparts,1,2,1,Uttarakhand

i had delhi by mistake in list of states for literacy but delhi paid more tax then whole state of karntka what do you want to say about that it is basic general knowledge in every country coastline states have higher gdp thats why people from other part will come their to work because companies setup industries in coastline territories but still delhi paid more tax delhi is landlocked which show southern part isnt doing that good either idk what does even north india means you are literally adding half of india in it there are northernmost state doing good but if you add central or west to it it ruins their name also,1,2,1,"Delhi, South-India"
wow you are really attacking uttarakhand huh what enmity do you have with our state the people of uttarakhand mostly work in army and tourism sectors i dont know from where you pulled out that half of all uttarakhand is moving to other states the only reason people move to dehradun haldwani haridwar etc are because mountains are really not very habitable places with frequent rains and landslides providing good healthcare in remote mountains is very hard because even pahadi doctors dont want to live in there i think dehradun has great public transport with city buses electric buses trackers everywhere and electric autos we have also planned to remove vikrams from the city as well just because we dont have metros doesnt mean our public transports are bad also dehradun has very low pollution and is extremely safe place to live in the per capita gdp of uttarakhand is higher than the national average as well i agree with you on one point though the outsiders coming to uttarakhand are really ruining the state and i want land laws like himanchal in uttarakhand as well we need to protect our pahadi culture from outsiders,1,2,1,Uttarakhand
atleast read the whole post first up bihar is not north india it is eastern india not north the part of up which comes in north india ncr is doing good go see the population of north indian states jk ladakh himachal uttarkhand haryana punjab population tamil nadu population,1,2,1,Bihar
check your sources man bro really based his whole argument off of okcredit tax revenue does not indicate development at all you can cry about it all you want but tere ko hi chutiya bana rhe hai itna revenue lene ke baad according to this up has highest revenue but we all know how much of a shithole that state is you are the one making it south vs rest of india then yall cry about why we hate mfs like you tryna spread hate people like you give north indian a bad rep here ong the north indians who live here in blr are chill asf and dont fucking cry on reddit about why they hate south india,0,0,0,
i clearly mentioned its either plain areas or other states not only the latter and yes the topography of uttarakhand is prone to seismic activities but that alone doesnt stand as a reason for migration lack of opportunities and public services still are more primary factors of people migrating from hilly areas and coming to the point of public transport except dehradun which other city in uttarakhand has a decent public transport system even state operated buses are stressed and distant hilly areas can only be covered by private taxis and that is after nearly 25 years of state formation and the reluctance of even native doctors to serve hilly areas is due to absence of bustling economic activity and other services not entirely due to geographical changes and all this does not paint an image of a state trailing kerala in charts of various development parameters,1,2,1,Uttarakhand
lol what when did they divide up excuses are like assholes bruh everyones got one and they all stink up is north india its right in the name itself,1,2,1,North-India
yes i dont know why karnataka has become a center of attention especially after the elections many seem to act as if they know better than the people of the state when they know shit about its politics i never saw a single post when karnataka was suffering by bad administration and corruption suddenly every small thing is blown out of proportion and somehow try to paint the voters as dumb and irresponsible just because the result of the electoral process was not to their liking nobody sees the reality lakhs of north indians are flourishing in bengaluru not only in it but as small business owners that too in core kannada old bengaluru areas and they go by their daily business without speaking kannada if kannadigas were not accommodating would it be possible i see this as the superiority complex of theses people who cannot take another view many of them cant stand the fact that we respect our culture and languages and expect them to do the same,1,2,1,Karnataka
up is north india ncr northern part of up can be considered north because people there are haryanvis jaat gurjar and economy of it is similiar to haryana people there are rich because of farming and noida just like haryana with gurgaon eastern part of up is bihari people speak bhojpuri there,1,2,2,"Uttar Pradesh, North-India, Haryana"

west bengal had a very ugly communist uprising in the 60s called the naxalbari movement there was a huge red wave with university students taking the streets along with farmers to topple the bourgeois government and elite oppressors of the society it turned ugly with lots of killings on both sides which continued up to early 70s with frequent military rule the communist party ruled from 19772011 the people were expecting a much better gov and social order as preached by the commies but instead all the industries declined and the state became underdeveloped with frequent political issues growing tired of them people elected a new party in 2011 so the red wave was pretty active in that area for many years but now people have moved on from it and hence excommies,0,0,0,

bengal as a colonial state endured multiple famines under the infamous british rule in contrast kerala although under colonial dominion was a princely state which meant it was a voluntary submission to the crown the colonial state did not interfere much with the internal affairs of kerala as long as the taxes which were quite high were paid after independence many of the colonial factories in bengal were purchased by indian elites who invested heavily to scale up production to meet the demand from east asian countries at its peak factories in kolkata produced goods that flooded the chinese markets however the masses were dissatisfied with this capitalist setup having suffered under colonial rule for over 200 years many bengalis believed or were led to believe that these oligarchs were british agents intent on exploiting cheap labor to enrich other countries the federal government then controlled by the centerleft congress deeply despised the communists to the point of openly shooting them to death the communist party of india cpi presented itself as the victim of this oligarchygovernment syndicate and by the next elections they were elected just a decade later kolkata once one of asias economic hubs comparable to presentday shanghai saw its masses hunting down businessmen torturing them to death on the streets and burning their houses businesses quickly packed their bags and moved to other states mostly to gujarat and maharashtra the state where mumbai is located in keralas case however the state was relatively affluent postcolonial rule with literacy rates higher than many european countries although communist economics did not really work there either much of keralas economy was sustained by remittances sent by its people working in different indian states or abroad,1,2,1,West Bengal

looks like you are not ready to accept the harsh reality of liberals being racist as a well uh my first sentence is me fully accepting that reality lol youre still making the same logical errors here reddit has lots of liberals probably a majority but very obviously reddit is not exclusively liberal its quite well known for its extremely active and influential right wing subs tdnald being the most famous so right off the bat youre making a basic error assuming everyone on here is liberal then youre assuming that racist comments which are common but not close to a majority of comments are representative of the average or largest group of users instead of a loud subset youre also taking two different categories of commentpost problm and antisouth asian racism and acting like they must be coming from the same people seeing two different narratives held by different groups and declaring that this represents a double standard this is the same error people make on sports and gaming subs all the time ohhh but reddit told me that teamgame x was bad s thats not to say that you cant find examples of a problm commenter being horribly racist against south asians you absolutely can but that doesnt mean that all or even all that many of the former do the latter this is all before we consider the facts that a rw subs have a long history of doing racist brigading all over reddit b there are statesupported troll farms actively blanketing this site with racist posts and comments in my country theyre actually specifically pushing antiindian racism,0,0,0,
he literally didnt say that he started with accepting liberals can be racist but pointing out reddit is not the same as all liberals id argue the kind of liberal such as myself that uses this site tends to be more techcentric and a lot of these racist sentiments are more techoriented than left or right in the workplace where you generally avoid politics and arguments it tends to be easier to unite and complain about a different team or group often one that is in a different country or otherwise not relatable the other point ive experienced as a minority is that all people are racist on some level we are predisposed to identifying and believing in patterns we see in our direct lives thinking chinese are naturally gifted at math for example at a high level racism is putting people in a box based on their race but if you were a minority you would know the difference im indian and am saddened by the racist portrayal of indians on reddit but these are people with opinions on the other hand i have had conservatives i dont know walk up to me and tell me to go back to my country ive been rejected by hr from joining teams that were over 95 white males because i was not diverse enough so they dont have to do this again this sort of racism whether left or right is very different from people just naturally being prejudiced,0,0,0,

punjabis overall are more social and outgoing than south indians for example look at all the indian top dogs in the usa nikki haley preet brara us ambassador to india even bobby jindal all from punjab south indians are meek though they are very studious they are typically the typical indian success student come to think of it cant name a single south indian whose popular in the usa except that comedian aziz ansari,1,2,1,Punjab

not attacking punjabis as i said theyre great people that id like to get to know better im opening this up to discussion so that we can collectively increase the sample size the idea of a stereotype is wrong and everyone has the opportunity to rise up and strike it down and when doing so we leave behind the twisted conceptions that society has for us and make ourselves a new independent identity and theres no better place to do that than in america a place where we get a fresh start to become whoever we want to be,1,2,1,Punjab
hes talking about overall trends not all individuals the number of punjabis in ivies is minuscule as compared to other desi groups well jatts at least,0,0,0,
you are correct that kerala is slightly wealthier than tamil nadu they make about 100 more per year per person their astonishing successes with literacy 100 and from my data set is partly attributed to their pioneering spirit of working in foreign lands to do absolutely anything in the hot suns of qatar or endure the most fanatic bedouin family as a nanny in kuwait their work ethic and zeal to help out the petrodollar economies of s arabia deserves our respect perhaps another reason they look down on tamils is because their state is gorgeous and tamil nadu is more arid and less beautiful the two languages are very similar however,1,2,1,Kerala
as a south indian im not sure i agree entirely but i do think we can learn from punjabis especially punjabi sikhs in terms of outreach to the wider nonindian community my parents generation have absolutely zero interest in communicating our traditions carnatic music the art the dance etc to the outside world they even shot down someones suggestion to host an interfaith exchange at our temple because they thought no one would be interested i feel like were way too insular as a community whereas punjabis actually try to reach out to others on campuses on social media through social movements and so on the general idea seems to be that our culture should be kept strictly inside the home outside were told to keep our head down work hard but stay in the background and dont attract too much attention i agree punjabis may have those not so kind traits but some punjabi communities are pretty open others are def closed off and are willing to help out people outside their respective communities like the punjabis in michigan who recently made food for the homeless near detroit i have some family who is part the big malayalee community there and it doesnt seem to me that they would ever do anything like that since like you said we are insular and will only help our own kind kinda sad since everyone in that area regardless of raceculture can create a community where everyone is supported and looks after each other in times of need will def help a lot especially in times like now,1,1,1,South-India

i really do detest how american magazines and media even brown media often written by north indian americans will write about indian weddings but paint it completely in a north indian way like no not every culture in india has a sangeet and haldi and baraat and wears lehenghas there is a whole section of indian culture that does weddings very differently that being said i think part of it is a pipeline problem how many tamilsouth indian folks in the uscanada do you know who go on to become wedding planners djs and small business owners as compared to punjabis and gujaratis of course their culture will be more prevalent in pop culture and entertainment as a broad generalization at least from what ive seen could be wrong south indian diaspora tend to stick to professional and academic occupations whereas there is more occupational and economic class variety in the diaspora of north indians i wonder if its also because punjabis have been in north america longer than most other groups who tend to be much newer wave immigrants after 1990,0,0,0,
but even when indians get representation in media or even in schools its almost as if indians are all exclusively north indian whose music is exclusively punjabi bhangra or bollywood songs it looks like south indian films are kinda beating out bollywood in india rn including the northern states so think this might change soon,1,1,1,North-India
well you just havent had the right situation as a tamil immigrant in us we have had gangs of us indians who are new staying and adjusting life together the initial rift goes out the window as soon as you start engaging the other person as a human with flaws and characters instead of just what they speak many times i have had a north indian or his family really help us in difficult situations when tamiltelugu person wont look past a stereotypical character i have had a patel roommate who cooked for me and shared about how he makes money while a tamil roommate robbed me hundreds of dollars many tamiltelugu close families didnt help us during pregnancy while a bengali family stepped forward to keep my older son many days this view is shared by my tamil wife who was initially reluctant in speaking to anyone non tamil her best friend she misses is a bengali i dont speak hindi you dont have to be ashamed for that be very open in your approach and you will find gems and rubbishes,0,0,0,

rajinikanth is actually really popular not just all over india but all over asia people in japa love rajinikanth the people in china love rajinikanth i casually mentioned rajinikanth in a conversation with one of my north indian friends and yeah he immediately knew him i just dont think rajni going to does a lot of interviews in the west like shahrukh khan does like shahrukh khan actively does promotion in the west whereas rajini doesnt really do that i do remember that quentin tarantino said one of the scenes in kill bill was inspired by a kamal hasan movie the music composer for slumdog millionaire was ar rahman who is from chennai and he even gave a speech in tamil at the oscars not that it really matters but maitreyi ramakrishnan is actually sri lankan although sri lankans and people from tamil nadu like you and me speak the same language basically look like us and talk like us and we share a lot of similarities i do think sri lankans have a certain pride in being sri lankan which is mainly why i wanted to point that out the director and costar of the film super troopers jay chandrasekhar his family also originates from tamil nadu same with the actor sendhil ramamurthy who is his cousin and yeah its natural to have different cultures from the north and south i mean just look at america we have different cultures from the east and west and south and north and the midwest northerners joke about how southerners dry up and crack their skin during the winter and cant handle the cold well us southerners can make a good barbecue and have this thing called southern hospitality but yeah it makes sense that north indians and south indians have different cultures i mean when i hear about weddings that last a weeklong its a bizarre thing for me to hear as a south indian because for us a marriage only lasts two days but can be shrunk down to 1 we have marriage at 600 am in the morning and we have a reception at 700 pm in the evening that can either be split into two days where we have the reception in the evening prior along with the marriage at the morning after or we have the marriage in the morning and then do the reception that evening but these weeklong marriages ive never experienced them the procession is one thing i did experience 7 years ago i think,0,0,0,
i get what youre saying media rep is usually overwhelmingly north indian aside from the patel jokes on tv where they dont even realize its a very regionalized surname and i felt like i never fit in because i dont know hindi aside from very rudimentary phrases and never watched much bollywood it was to the point where fellow south indians would watch bollywood so i felt left out of that as well but im hopeful the tide is turning the two ladies on bridgerton are a sri lankan tamil and an indian tamil and slowly but surely things are changing i do want to say that i am very concerned over how much of the new era of south indian stars and scientists are overwhelmingly coming from the tamil brahmin community its great were doing well i just dont want our successes to overshadow the stories and contributions of people outside this very small community south india is more than just tamils and more than just upper caste folks,1,1,1,North-India
also tamil and i feel the exact same way i definitely have friends who are north indian but i just dont have as many of the same things in common which isnt really a surprise lol i couldnt pick up hindi either i will say though i think growing up i maybe resented being lumped in with north indian culture because thats what represented india here in the us even more so a decade ago people asking if i spoke hindi or watched bollywood or knew certain songsactors that kind of thing i dont want to get too political but im proud of being tamilsouth indian too and those kinds of innocuous remarks am i allowed to call them microaggressions put me on the defensive just to avoid feeling erased in a way not sure if that made any sense at all but thats how i feel about it,1,2,1,North-India

i think this has largely to do with the internalized racism that exists in india region wise hindi speaking states have better cultural links with other states than as compared to south indian states particularly tamil nadu and this has largely to do with their particular dislike towards hindi language now heres one issue its not about hindi imposition but pragmatically speaking learning hindi would indeed enable to connect better with northern states even states like maharashtra gujarat or west bengal keep in mind these states primary language isnt hindi however they still have better links relatively with other north indian states simply due to relatively higher acceptance tamil people dislike for that automatically means theyre in the minority and will be suppressed by the majority in terms of representation now another argument comes that we dont need hindi and we can manage with english just as well i disagree with that english though a global language and does have an upper edge in the world in terms of its importance however it doesnt really have that much of cultural ties in india itself it isnt well understood by most indians cultural ties isnt just about managing but its more about connecting and having more representation since hindi is the official language of the union hindi speakers would always have more representation in india even if it is spoken as a second language at least until a different language takes over this means that northern india has no cultures ties with southern india whatsoever and most likely india would end up being divided sooner or later does that mean we must let hindi destroy regional languages and cultures like i said more than hindi imposition or protecting tamil cultural identity it is about connecting with each other north indians and south indians are both equally racist in this sense isnt diversity our strength it totally depends on how the diversity is being perceived diversity for the sake of it is definitely not our strength because for a country to be connected together there needs to be cultural connect between the diverse regions and cultures of the country and this is an area where india fails miserably indias diversity lacks the harmony its hard to point out whose fault is this north indians or south indians or politicians or everyone is equally responsible for the same what is the solution i believe that the solution is to respect all cultures equally and not be hypocritical in the sense to not give assertions about how one culture is inherently superior to another one the moment there is this imbalance on either side it would create a divide but i am trying to learn hindi and find it hard to learn and we still get underrepresented its not about you but about the entire culture that has emerged due to this hyper nationalist attitude of one particular culture being dominant over another culture this cant be changed overnight by one person but each and every person would need to do that and this includes every indian,0,0,0,

i kinda get it my parents grew up in pakistan but my moms family came from ap and tn growing up in america i always considered my self both pakstani and indian and in our local community we had a decent mix of pakistanis and both north and south indians but when i was 18 i moved to karachi on my own and realised there was a huge cultural gap even with other diaspora kids the food was different and i always felt sad about south indian food i spoke fluent urdu but i still had to change some of my vocabulary for people to understand me even though hindi serials are popular like i couldnt say kahe ko instead of kyun i occaisionally had pple staring at me because i dont look north indian or pakistani enough and ppl were way to ok with mocking south indians one bitch asked me if i was real tamil or sri lankan like wow that is loaded my roommates aunt met me and just stared for a while and then asked me in english if i was indian and whyhow i was there also i judge pakistani pakistanis when they wear sarees ive been to weddings were everyone is glitzed out and someone would show up in the blandest possible saree not even quality fabric the sort of thing id see my friends grans wear at home they just thought the fact it was a saree made it fancy and put in no effort i met plenty of biharis rajistahanis and gujratis but my presence just broke ppls brains so youre hyderabadi not quite babes,0,0,0,

as a gujarati guy in the bay area i feel like there is a lot more south indian representation in america than any other region next comes punjabis and after that comes gujaratis in the last 30 or so years there hasnt been much representation of hindi belt indians unless you count priyanka chopra even ashwariya rai was from karnataka many of the most famous indian american scientists from the sixties onward were south indian too chandrasekhar ramachandran,1,2,1,Gujarat
oh damn i didnt know the bridgerton women were tamil too i think theres a lot of representation in high power politicaleconomic roles in the west but typically not much in western media since south indians conform even less to eurocentric beauty standards than north indians mindy kaling was such a refreshing exception to the standard looks white but with tanned skin vibe so the bridgerton thing is cool,0,0,0,
thank you all south asians deserve representation however right now the north indian experience is the only one people seem to care about i think north indian culture is beautiful and rich but when i hear that there will be a show with a tamil american protagonist it kills me a little to see mostly north indian actors on the show not getting the zha sound right when speaking tamil pronouncing tamil tahmil and listening to bollywood songs and movies,0,0,0,

yall gujjus always gotta make everything about you yes we know where gujarat is we know about your culture the food the dances the politics we learned about you because we had to your language is indoaryan and has the same roots as hindi so we group you with north indians meanwhile how many gujjus can point to kerala or tamil nadu on a map how many gujjus even know that andhra pradesh and telangana split up i have sympathy for the underrepresented groups that get grouped into north india but i got no sympathy for yall,1,2,1,Gujarat

its not massively stupid because i think the lived experience of south indians is what informs that stereotype of anything above ap being the north italians have the same thing as well southern italians think anything above rome is the north but if you ask someone from tuscany or umbria if they are northern italian they dont really consider themselves that and think that really applies to lombardia piemonte veneto fwiw i do instinctively consider gujjus to be northern i used to consider marathis north but ive slowly changed my attitude on that,0,0,0,
totally agree the biggest issue is that each side has a false and flat idea of what the other is and the definition varies even then not all southern states are the same nor all northern states and depending on who you ask nobody is agreeing on where north begins and ends the desi community on tiktok for example thinks that all of north india is literally just punjabdelhi but indians in india will say north referring to just upbihar i dont even think saying anything north of the 5 sourthern states is all northern is stupid i just want one single definition,0,0,0,

interesting i can definitely see how south indians would consider gujjus north indian and although its not geographically accurate i could even see north indians seeing yall as south indians i dont think west indian would catch on for gujjus though because west indian has historically referred to indians who were taken out of india and brought to the caribbean by the british via indentured servitude indocaribbean populations in places like guyana trinidad suriname etc are commonly referred to as west indian central indian could work but im not sure that would catch on either,0,0,0,

i think that what the person meant is that all indian culture is presented as interchangeable if you ask any white person or any non indian person what they think about indian culture they will talk about bollywood chicken curry bollywood delhi etc however this does not represent all indians south indian culture is unknown to much of the world south asian terms like desi and bindi which a lot of nonsouth asians actually know are hindi derived words do you see what i mean im not saying that south indians are oppressed or anything but even in shows like never have i ever which features a tamil protagonist tamil culture is smushed together with north indian culture the only two tamil actors on the show are maitreyi and sendhil ramamurthy the accent used by the mom is unlike any south indian accent ive ever heard they play bollywood songs and the north indian actors butcher the few tamil words featured in the show people dont know about andhra or tamil nadu or karnataka they look at your brown skin and black hair and compare you to priyanka chopra they say namaste they assume you speak hindi have family in mumbai or delhi they ask what bollywood movies you like ive seen this from both nonindians and north indians alike,0,0,0,

allu arjun yes definitely vijay devarkonda not really there are other telugu actors who are much more popular in north compared to vijay devarkonda the popularity of telugu actors is not sudden phenomenon hindi satelite tv channels started showing dub movies in non prime shows since the rights in north india were cheaper compared to bollywood movies as time passed and more and more people started watching them on tv they got fan following in north too then after the rise of internet in india they started uploading hindi dubbed telugu movies for free on youtube and that helped expand the reach even further also not all recent bollywood movies are bad yes the mainstream ones have lost their appeal and quality but there are still a lot of really good indie and small bollywood films which unfortunately dont get the attention and love they deserve thanks to ott however they now have a platform too people here are hypocrites they want good content and hate on mainstream bollywood but they dont support quality content,0,0,0,

it depends on what your definition of north is thats literally my whole point those states all have a lot in common culturally linguistically and ethnically to other northern states they also have a lot different because india is super diverse and simple labels like northsouth arent good enough to encompass all of it hell even statehood is a really shit metric for cultural categories a better metric for cultural connection would be language groups a haryanvi person from noida has way more in common culturally with a haryanvi person from haryana than with a bhojpuri person from banares even though theyre from the same state,0,0,0,

ah your right i should have done a little more research thank you for pointing these things out also one quick point the fact that south indian i will lead with tamil cinema uses north indian women more than south indian women is sort of a form of colorism given that most of those north indian women are praised for their lighter skin not saying that all north indian women are light skinned just pointing out that tamil directors dont seem to consider tamil women for films very much,0,0,0,
ikr i get that bollywood is obviously popular but really it would have been refreshing to hear like a carnatic song the bollywood thing felt like a reflection of mindys own childhood and a way to appeal to white viewers i dont even know one tamil family that listens to bollywood im not saying that none do but our mannerisms feel unique and that was totally ignored in the show,0,0,0,

name an example of an me company with a high ranking desi in me,0,0,0,
maybe its possible they do a few other things but its mostly just a bride and groom do it with their parents and a priest at separate locations without guests i know usually after the wedding they go to a bunch of different temples that day i dont know if they do anything prior to that day i only go to the wedding and the reception,0,0,0,
every single one i ever been to was a twoday event the reception the night before and the wedding the morning of what you say seems like they do all on the same wedding day cuz i do remember recalling that specific word not sure if part of reception or during the morning of wedding but after the thali and lunch we are out cuz i do remember on the actual wedding date they do this thing at 600 am in the morning and then i think they do the sari change and the thali but still just a 2day event that can be shrunk down to 1,0,0,0,
and the current pm is gujarati so by default weve all had to learn about your culture this makes zero sense how did indian pm being gujarati made you learn about gujarati culture why do we abds give a shit about indias pm with our parents its kinda understandable but why us,0,0,0,
never but i did want to make a point about that north and south indians are different bengalis as an ethnicity technically count as north indian just not bangladeshis,0,0,0,
i guess its more of the fact that all sas are forced to conform to such stereotypes rather than a north india vs south india thing i apologize for any wrong words,0,0,0,
idk how north indian temples are but at our dravidian temples youd never even hear music other than sangeetham or prayer recitals it was so obv they were pandering to north indians smh they even shortened the priests name from a south indian name to some bastardized north indian version,0,0,0,

keralite here kerala is like part of two of the bottom states in india the food from both these places are little similar but kerala seems to have more distinctive flavors compared to the rest may be your brother had a limited variety of food all the states in the south have their own distinct cuisine i guess the availability of different foods in a kerala restaurant is far more than others the language is completely unique from anything else from the north and the middle states malayalam is a dravidian language similar to other south indian languages as unique or special as any other the chill factor also seems to be different people seems to be more relaxed they also seems to have their own alcohol i wonder how much of a factor that plays i dont know about the chill factor may be your brother found that the people were more relaxed in a houseboat place like alappey in any case absolutely nothing to do with having our own alcohol though toddy is great you cannot drink it with abandon because of the amount of spurious toddy in the market also its quite similar to beer need to drink a lot to get drunk most people do not consume toddy and prefer other types of alcohol keralites do drink a lot there seems to be a quite a lot of lighter skin complexion in kerala as well compared to the other state at the bottom and the middle ones how did that happen what is the history of this small state i would wager karnataka on an average has more lighter people than kerala kerala has the history of lot of communities mixing could be because of that arabs jews and christians etc etc what is the history of this small state wikipedia a lot to write unfortunately certain periods of the history is not studied properly,0,0,0,
i feel kerala is really weird when it comes to its uniqueness its still prudish with the kind of clothes we wear or the general level of freedom one might experience in comparison with cities like bangalore or mumbai but on the whole majority of the people are much more liberal with core issues like religion caste politics etc plus the divide between the rich and the poor is not as extreme as the rest of india thanks to the land reforms in the 60s this in itself gave economic and social freedom to most and kerala could concentrate on other areas of development and women are treated much better than in any other state of that im certain possibly because of education and older matrilineal systems that once existed,0,0,0,
i can write as an outsider yes an aussie kerala has a very large chritian community as well a large muslim community religion is very important but it is the mutual respect of multiculturalism that is key kerala has been trading with the west for over 2000 years mainly spices do not forget that kerala elected a communist government tldr kerala is different due to mutual respect of the different religions,0,0,0,
this question is dangerously close to quota territory the question itself carries its own assertion asserts it to be true and then asks why it is true,0,0,0,

language its mix of dravidan languages and sanskrit culture same as above but with more dravidan culture but was quick to take from aryan culture too chill factor climate and natural beauty its very tough to be bitter in a place as beautiful as kerala skin tone keralamalabar was a port with a long history even had diplomatic relations with romanarabeuropean even before vasco da gama and as the trade was in all time high people stayed back or married into people of kerala there were even shaivates from kashmir in kerala so yeah that explains the skin tone opinion most of the people have about mallu is stereotypical as fuck either people think you are damn smart or there will be a questions like why are you not dark when you are from the south also keralites arent really into the stupid north vs south thing because our culture is heavily borrowed from the northern and tamil dravidan so if we thing any of them suck we suck too also unlike what everyone thinks kerala has a lot of problems but yeah compared to some northern states kerala enjoy a good hdi and stuff its not because keralites are special or anything it just because of the social reforms like women empowerment and education so cut the hype already we are all culturally very much alike with some variety with love a mallu,0,0,0,
alright before i begin im a malayali but born and brought up in mumbai so ill try my best to answer as much as i know food no idea sorry not a culinary expert language malayalam is a dravidian language and the northern laguages fall under the category of indoaryan languages hindi and the other northern languages have more in common with english or so ive read than with malayalam or the other southern languages however that also means malayalam tamil kannada tulu telugu etc have a lot in common and thats true i cannot speak these other languages but i can understand about 2550 of them when heard chill factor i wouldnt know much about this since i only visit kerala once in 34 years for short trips but theyre not really that chill at least not when it comes to politics theyre the most politically aware state of india and hold hartals and such almost every other day theres a lot of casteism too apparently malayalis are also known to be some of the worst cynics however they can take a joke about themselves pretty chill like that alcohol i dont live in kerala so no great idea about this but keralites gulp down the most per capita alcohol in india and i guess the alcohol you say is indigenous to them is toddy i never had it so i cant confirm its effects on people skin color this has to do with the aryandravidian assimilation patterns and i doubt anyone in india can give you a solid supported answer for this since were such a diverse and mixed country when it comes to race the government doesnt recognize it in the census thus limiting much research about it history best option would be to refer to google and some history sites the indian subcontinent has been inhabited since eons now and its very difficult for me to make the history of a part of it concise in a reddit post opinions about keralitesmallus this i experience everyday most of the people from the north just consider you a madrasi they cant even figure out which state malayalam is spoken in or if theres any difference between kerala and tamil nadu theres lots however for the ones who do know more about kerala theyll likely stereotype you as educated family lots of relatives in the middle east and abroad and think that kerala is probably the best state in india thanks to geography textbooks ive yet to hear any bad stereotypes specifically for malayalis all there are are a few jokes common to south india funny accent idli sambar and whatnot known for maybe easier to identify as nerds for some reason i think many people connect high literacy with being more smart or something because ive met people who assume im academically gifted because i say my family is malayali fuck the fact that i personally have little to nothing to do with the state but thats about all that you can expect people to know about keralites since kerala is after all a major state with less influence in overall indian politics ps all stereotypes mentioned are what i hear from other people not confirming that any of them are actually traits seen among keralites,0,0,0,
wut as a malayalee i find there is a lot in common the differences arent any more than what i would expect from say gujarat and the rest of india and yeah the language is quite different from the north and middle states but guess what it is really similar to languages from the southern states i find that in some cases kerala has more in common with bengal,1,2,1,Gujarat
there seems to be a quite a lot of lighter skin complexion in kerala as well compared to the other state at the bottom and the middle ones its because of arab influence arabs were trading with kerala for centuries it also has the oldest mosque in india a 7th century structure,1,2,1,Kerala

its not mutually intelligible like hindi and urdu but if one knows tamil they can easily pick up on malayalam and vice versa due to the structure of the language malayalam and tamil also share a unique common consonant the zh in allapuzha its not allapuzzza as most northies pronounce it amitabh bacchan in kbc mispronouncing it gave me the chills the written word for both languages while looking similar are completely different telegu and kannada share a similar relationship as tamil and malayalam,0,0,0,
a tamil friend of mine said that they can understand malayalam and vice versa there are a few common words but the ability for a tamilian to understand malayalam or telugu is also partly because of the cultural mix there are a lot of telugu and mallu people in tn and in popular culture as well that a few words in malayalam and telugu are commonknowledge in tn in any language you only need a basic few words to understand what the essence of the communication is,1,2,1,Tamil Nadu
none of the major south indian languages are mutually intelligible while there are a lot of similiarities because of the dravidian roots a kannada speaker for instance cannot readily comprehend tamil and vice versa except perhaps for certain dialects of tamil and malayalam the two languages diverged relatively late,0,0,0,
i think the chill he is talking about is the very slow paced life,0,0,0,
its because of arab influence i know a lot nairs nambiars and malayali christians who have light skin does that mean they are all of arab blood,0,0,0,
not arab influence alone fairer folks of other communities dont have that distinct middleeast look there has been a lot of influx of other communities as well persecuted jews and christians from iran a lot of brahmins who originally came from far north,0,0,0,
polyyandry in kerala is not sharing wife with priests in the nair community men were supposed to be warriors and women could get into a relationship with multiple men same must have been true for couple of other communities as well but the brahmins never come into picture here namboodiris brahmins were allowed to have nair wives these women did not have other husbands a big fucking rofl at white man kerala already had a big christian population before colonial periods fairer christians mostly belong to these communities not the newer ones,0,0,0,
yes im sorry i completely forgot to think of the ner,0,0,0,
yeah absolutely eve teasing is kind of really bad which is surprising considering women are treated extremely well within the society its something i just dont get like mallus will never dream of sideling their women to the kitchen and does not follow gender roles as much but will catcall and stare at them like theres no tomorrow,0,0,0,
op must be a north indian who knows nothing about the rest of india,0,0,0,
also this is the first time i hearing someone calling keralite light skinned as it is with everywhere else the higher castes nairs nambiarsetc in kerala are pretty lightskinned,0,0,0,
while the script for telugu and kannada are similar the languages are not really that similar kannada is more similar to tamil than telugu,0,0,0,
makes sense thanks for correcting as i said just something i happened to read on the internet long ago and it wasnt even a credible source,0,0,0,
malayalam and hindi are as different from each other as english and hindi are malayalam is not even an indo european language so it doesnt share origins with english and hindi,0,0,0,
hindi and english are both indo european english traces its ancestry via the germanic branch whereas hindi through the indoiranian branch so looking at it that way malayalam is even less related to hindi the similarity to hindi is largely based on words of sanskrit origin in malayalam there is a huge amount of sanskrit influence but grammatically hindi and malayalam are quite distinct english and hindi share more grammatical features because of their ie heritage,0,0,0,
definitely all of them are not arab blood but many of them have distinct middle eastern features,0,0,0,
i have seen lot of people who doesnt belong to this group who are fair too muslims other castes which you didnt mention and even the question is kind of creep its on the border of white awesome,0,0,0,
i agree with the fact that they are treated well generally and are encouraged to pursue education but when it comes to things like marriage the girl however educated will have to be shipped off once she turns 2223 things are convenient for the guy although this is a problem at large for india we still have not improved in this regard which is why i feel we still have to progress in terms of doing away with gender roles i mean the woman is still expected to cook and take care of the house and kids its changing but the mentality still exists and the whole judgmental malayali attitude still prevails wherein a guy can do whatever he wants and no one could care lessbut a woman doing things like smoking drinking is considered taboo,0,0,0,
op must be south indian who know nothing about rest of india,0,0,0,
not really nairs are pretty diverse when it comes to complexion within my family we are diverse when it comes to complexion my wife and her sisters are perfect examples her elder sister is quite dark my wheatish dark and her younger sister is quite fair they look quite alike as well,0,0,0,
is sanskrit the mother of hindi not the bollywood type and malayalam,0,0,0,
kerala had prechristian trade linkages with the middle east and not just with arabs both christianity and islam have come in into kerala through these linkages as for fair skin arabs might have had a minor influence that is confined to the muslim community which is under 27 of the population a much larger contribution would perhaps be north indian aryans which includes kerala brahmin west coast brahmins as well as tamil brahmins which is further confirmed by the sanskrit content of malayalam as well as numerous folktraditional arts literature in addition to religion,0,0,0,
taking a brahmin wife not the usual case at all namboodiris used to nair women as wives not the other way round infact namboodiri women were probably the most repressed class in erstwhile kerala,0,0,0,
i disagree in this generation at least most girls i know whether its in family or friends or extended circles have only gotten married at 25 or 26 sometimes even later see the point is for all the superb hdi rankings that we may have kerala is still an entity in the third world with conservative roots what im trying to say is that women will not be ostracized for being a divorcee or a widow unlike a lot of other states and anecdotal it may be but the couples i know share their household responsibilities more or less equally its not perfect but its not as bad as most others with regard to prudishness kerala is the worst guys smoking and drinking and running around in knickers no one bats an eyelid a girl steps out in so much as a sleeveless kurti and shes game for eveteasing so yeah its weird but at least you will never get honourmurdered for marrying outside your caste,0,0,0,
quite possibly i hadnt considered that,0,0,0,
well by that logic you can make the case for hundreds of languages being similar even though theyre not from the same family,0,0,0,
malayalam borrows some vocabulary from sanskrit not the structure whereas hindi is a direct descendent of sanskrit,0,0,0,
hindi yes malayalam no,0,0,0,
sanskrit is the mother of hindi but not malayalam,0,0,0,
no the grammatical structure in malayalam is totally different njan ayale malayennu erriyam povannu notice one major difference there is no direct from preposition instead malayalam has prepositional suffixes like other languages in the dravidian family do,0,0,0,
come off it you cant literally use one sentence as an example of look how similardifferent the grammar is i dont know about malayalam but based on tamil there are countless grammatical differences genders rationalityirrationality demonstrative prefixes agglutination an attitudinal verbal system suffixing pronouns to verbs to indicate person wat evidentiality love this feature clusivity in firstperson plural pronouns no copula no relative pronouns etc literally the only factors that hindi and tamil have in common but not english is off the top of my head the lack of articles sov word order and postpositional syntax malayalam is mutually intelligible with tamil to a large extent afaik so most of this also applies there,0,0,0,
til i was told it was the other way round edit ok i got the source of my confusion the brahmins did take nair wives but the marriages were matrilineal and the children became nairs so essentially the nairs were taking brahmin husbands,0,0,0,
my point was that there is undue pressure on the girl to get married early regardless of her educational status are things better than many other states definitely could it be better certainly i have seen cases both good and bad ultimately it boils down to how progressiveconservative the respective families involved are but the double standard when it comes to women must change,0,0,0,
really does malayalam not have large number of words from sanskrit,0,0,0,
yup thats correct all these marriages were matrilineal,0,0,0,
i think as with everything else in the end it does come down to your immediate family and how they are so yeah,0,0,0,
god damn these languages are together for hundreds of years of course they are going to be influenced by each other but that doesnot mean they have shared ancestry edit a word,0,0,0,
englishs grammar is far closer to hindis than malayalams is malayalam is an agglutinative language hindi is barely synthetic,0,0,0,
yes borrowed because of geographical proximity,0,0,0,
no my point is that hindi is way closer grammatically to english and other european languages than it is to malayalam,0,0,0,
proximity to is it sanskrit more with less malayalam or more malayalam with less sanskrit,0,0,0,
it is grammatically a dravidian language with a few sanskrit loanwords there is no less and more it originated from tamil,0,0,0,

lived in bangalore for three years and never faced this problem if anything everyone was accommodating and spoke english to me i did notice that sometimes hindi speakers would try to enforce hindi which was understandably met with resistance india like you said is multicultural and multilingual and hindi is not a native of the south,1,2,1,Karnataka
get off reddit a city which doesnt even have the majority as kannadigas is becoming racist and jingoistic for millennia people have migrated to bangalore thats why less than half of bangalores population is kannadiga there are large minorities of tamil telugu and marathi people that have lived here for ages not to mention tuluvas konkanis jains punjabis rajasthans etc now hindi heartland people are also coming and the city has welcomed everyone with open arms,1,2,1,Karnataka
5 years in bangalore and i havent faced this yet kannadigas are way more accommodating than any other southern states there are minor instances like these but by no means is it widespread also wont hurt you to learn just the basics of native language of the region you are residing in if someone pushes you regarding language just tell them nanu kannada kalita idini swalpa swalpa kannada gottu,1,1,1,Karnataka
i took my parents to some upscale restaurant my mum doesnt know any other language than kannada reached the restaurant before rest of us could come she can read english and understand basics so the waiter came and told her some recommendations in english my mum is like can you tell that in kannada the waiter switched to hindi again repeating same thing mom wanted know something about the food in menu but couldnt get it to convey him my mum bless her heart politely asked him if he can find someone else who can speak kannada the couldnt get it what she was saying mistook it as some aggressive approach gets manager surprise he doesnt know kannada either so they are like we cant off the menu and just aggressively asking to point at what she wants no one in staff spole kannada after few minutes as was about to move her to accommodate another group of customers we came in she felt offended and raised voice with manager as to why no one can speak kannada here we just decided to eat something else in another restaurant even we were quite perplexed as to how this has become a cesspool of different languages yet none of the north and north east people in that restaurant couldnt speak single word of kannada apparently the only manager who could speak kannada was on leave now you tell me should my mom learn another language just to get service in her home state or these people in service industry learn the language of the people they are going to serve i agree that they shouldnt get threatened or use violence but am i going to look down on people who come here to live without even trying to learn the language of the city they have decided to settle yep,0,0,0,
i mean why is it racist you go their state why is it so hard for you to learn the local language and culture as a tamil speaking indian i stand with kannadigas in this i respect every other language and culture you go and live their state and land learn and respect the locals,1,2,1,"North-India, West-India, East-India"
im bangalore born bred so ive seen the trend from both sides over the years especially with the renewed attempts at hindi imposition please read about what happened in the 60s when they tried to impose hindi i should also mention i am also very fluent in hindi in fact i can still read hindi better than kannada because i was never taught kannada in school kannadigas are extremely welcoming and accommodating most people in bangalore know enough hindi to converse in it and this is in spite of many of them going to kannadamedium schools which means they learnt hindi so as to understand people from other states same goes for tamil telugu in the same period of time ive also seen the influx of people into bangalore many from the hindi heartland and many of these people dont bother to learn kannada they dont even try and worse ive had situations where people demand that others speak to them in hindi how would you expect the locals to react in such situations when they feel alienated in their own place a genuine attempt to learn kannada even a working knowledge goes a long long way youll see malayalis migrate to bangalore and speak excellent even if heavily accented kannada in a year or so same goes for marwaris who move to bangalore to work in their relatives shops these are people who dont speak a shred of kannada but very quickly pick it up to the point of nearproficiency its not a difficult language,1,2,1,Karnataka
by the way have you wondered about how the so called indian govt has slowly been trying to make hindi the national language even though no one in most south indian states care a damn about hindi it is just as foreign to any of us as french,0,0,0,

it has been for quite a while because they want to project karnataka kannada only i have no issue if they ask for government services in kannada but asking shops or private vehicles or strangers to use only kannada is pure idiocy whats worse is that i had visited many states in india and many countries in south east asia but only in karnataka i have seen people even beating outsiders for not knowing kannada and for those who never faced such fanatics or know about it go youtube or news channels to search for such incidents if youre having option choose hyderabad or chennai,1,1,1,Karnataka

if you dont know cbse did this thing where kannada is compulsory and you can choose an additional language essentially kannada becomes language 12 and the nonnatives mother tongue is language 3 that has certainly been a challenge for a lot of people language wars have been going on for a long time recently they even dropped off some letters from the kannada alphabet because they were not pure and derived from sanskrit and if you spend enough time on rbangalore you will be able to see that most of them definitely dont like the northies that migrated in y2k and feel like their culture has been contaminated with hindi bollywood and other things but coming from a north indian family in north indian communities they arent particularly kind either and just dont respect a culture different from theirs so its retaliation because things arent that tense between tamilians andries or keralites and kannadigas in recent years it has been more divisive and they arent trying to protect their culture they are trying to subdue northern culture that came with mass migration and got intermixed theres certainly an element of xenophobia going beyond 1st gen immigrants making snide remarks,0,0,0,

no although i am not from karnataka but as part of my work i study states of southern india i will not disagree with what you feel but there is a difference what we get to listen and what actually happens karnataka is not becoming a jingoistic state its just that the news propagated in northern india and hindi media about karnataka are most of the times jingoistic in nature watch a kannada news channel for a week and watch a hindi news channel for a week note the news you will see that lots of good news are not making it to hindienglish media of northern india from karnataka and there even is an answer for that which is in karnataka only among all states of southern india karnatakas political scene is similar to prevalent political scene in northern indian states and some characters of that scene need such jingoism to stay relevant and advantageous in power struggle so they project karnataka in a certain way which is definitely not,0,0,0,

i beg to differ with the majority of the comments as a keralite in bangalore today whilst walking with my friends on the road a man on a scooter beeped so hard with the horn and hit my friend with his scooter from the back i asked him why he hit him with the scooter in malayalam he suddenly threatens me in kannada and uses slangs and calls me boli maga and goes on with his scooter the ground reality is if this situation excalated the police here and the locals here would side with him even when hes completely wrong they get hostile if we question them for a wrong from their part and we non kannada speaking people just get mute when they speak kannada because we know we will be put at fault in the end and become victims of either verbal or physical assault,1,1,1,Kerala
some kannadigas are not polite they demand you to know theirlanguage we all respect kannada not knowing a language doesnt mean disrespecting it also hindi not mother tongue all north indians north india has many languages like punjabi haryanvi bhojpuri gujrati bengali etc but we still put our ego aside and try to communicate in a common popular language hindi or english if everyone will hold onto there ego to only speak in there mother tongue then communication will become difficult and this ego will divide the country this is something all of us need to understand and ask ourselves who is actually dividing us,1,2,1,Karnataka

its my 1st year in bangalore and i have faced this i love playing volleyball im from north india as i moved here i searched for ground to play volleyball locally i went there to play and i know m new so they wont let me play any lead positions but even after proving my skills they just dont seem to care and even some of em try to tell others to not pass the ball towards mei agree not all of them are like this but some of them make sure i am being bullied properly,0,0,0,
change the state to some other north indian state and language to hindi and see how the plot changes suddenly ppl start telling u that u should know and converse in hindi as its our national language which isnt true u get mocked and go unanswered or get no response from them if u dont speak in hindi they wont speak about all these but karnataka which was formed by merging all the kannada speaking districts has to be open to all other languages that will be spoken here mostly by outsidersnon kannadigas only cuz english is somehow bridging the gap between hindi speaking states and non hindi speaking migraters doesnt mean the treatment has changed if u expect me to talk to u in hindi when im in your state me expecting u to learn kannada is also the same na vice versa uve come here ive not come there decades have rolled we almost lost our own language and culture which still continues to decline to present day and instead of protecting what makes us us u expect us to leave everything behind and embrace your language and culture grow up,1,2,1,Karnataka

ive lived in tamil nadu for 4 years bangalore for 2 years and southwest us for 6 years i dont know tamil or kannada so i should spend my time learning the languages everywhere or i dont deserve respect the point of being an indian or living in a healthy democracy is that inspite of background or language one is able to live and thrive you are missing the point karnataka reaped its rewards when it was an inviting and friendly utopia for people coming in and working from all parts of india it will in the same way also suffer once it stops being a friendly state and becomes more jingoistic and your perspective and thinking is part of the problem,0,0,0,
yes while hooliganism and physically forcing people to speak kannada is never ideal the idea is for people whove been living for years in karnataka should atleast know basic kannada nobody is asking them to be able to read kannada newspapers im nonkannadiga and not even from there but i always thought this shouldnt be that much of an issue for people to pick up the local language,0,0,0,

karnataka reaped its rewards when it was an inviting and friendly utopia for people coming in and working from all parts of india it will in the same way also suffer once it stops being a friendly state and becomes more jingoistic haha sure ask the migrant labourers from bihar to not come to bangalore because it is jingoistic lets see if they get employment in their home state why do you think poor people leave the cow belt why do you think this problem started theres no employment for the poor people anyway in the cow belt forget about hospitals and govt infra,1,1,1,Karnataka
its not about karnataka or delhi its basic value i feel u are not loosing anything by learning and it is added to your language skill set give me one disadvantage of learning a language it does stem from internal racism for many cause theyll proudly showcase their european language skill set if any if its learning any other indian language it is hard and cant really showcase it anywhere it shouldnt be forced i agree but its really not difficult to learn at least basics to manage on day to day basis with vendors shopkeepers and cab drivers if thats hard as well i dont know what to say i learnt proper hindi cause i wanted tosome people from north think if u know hindi and english u dont need to learn another language even if u have time and resources to learn it and i dont see the same people shy away from learning spanish or french for no reason and they proudly showcase the same,0,0,0,

depends on where south maharashtra probably also not all north indians speak hindi bihari migrants faced similar consequences when they migrated to marathi dominated bombay and gujratis and the north east states cant understand each other thats not imposition imposition is when you dont need something for survival but people are shoving it down your throat because they are xenophobic bigots china isnt imposing chinese on immigrants but sweden is as you can live there with english but you need to know swedish,0,0,0,

haha i was just messing with you bro you have explained the word imposition pretty well as if someones forcing us to learn things we dont need its obviously bigotry at the same time we should be considerate of those who dont know our languages but need it for survival by helping them understand us talking in hindi if we know with a bihariodhisa migrant labour who has only been here for a while would help him more than we realise a lot of these people come to provide better life for their families and its unfortunately these people who face majority of issues caused by some self proclaimed language protectors hooligans with that said its not as black and white as we make it though things are often grey and its why theres so much cries from both sides these days hope it all changes one day good night,0,0,0,

in karnataka people who know hindi or english will easily talk to you in the language you speak my point is that its wrong to expect everyone to speak a non native language idk what paying taxes to state has to do with this and believe me when i say this you need not be a kannada scholar just a few basics go a long way in making your life easier plus you can snoop in on the conversations of your kannada colleagues or shopkeepers who wont expect you to know the language,0,0,0,
but what about people who are new to the region no one is asking new commers to become experts it is jutified to expect basic speaking skills or atleast an effort to pick up the local language if im residing for a long time then of course ill pick up a few words and sentences helpful enough to get me through daily tasks you did the bare minimum some people dont put this minimum effort even after staying for years,0,0,0,

theres a reason people keep baseball bats under their car seat in the ncr gurgaon region not everyone is like that but theres a reason for the stereotype some folks are intentionally boisterous and proud about it for some reason back in the day there was a punjabi grad who had joined our team at banglore i kid you not the dude got depressed and left in 6 months because according to him yaha koi mazze hi nai karta and apparently we dont fight after drinks no kalesh which he apparently missed so uncool was the guy immature yes can he be better yes but not necessarily maybe if he reflects after seeing your post edit now that i read this i feel ive left out some parts this isnt a strictly regional thing ever place has versions of this the thing is every culture will have something or the other like this and there will be people who will look for conflict and thrive in gundagardi it is easier to associate this with the punjabijatt stereotype because theyre easier to spot but as you spend more time with people across cultures youll find a set of people to be like this ive seen this across the board from telugu speaking rowdies to white clothed kannadigas that you never mess around with and similar marathi folks as well have seen rowdy upbihar peeps and very unexpectedly odiabong and assamese as well im sure there will be some sort of german equivalent of you spend time across different kinds of population sections so it boils down to this you cant change peoples behaviour what you can change is what you do dont waste your energy in those interactions and avoid those social groups you can have the misfortune to run into a similar kind of people in any part of the world but for some reason these qualities seem to be exaggerated in the haryanapunjabncr belt but that doesnt mean everyone is like that you just have to avoid those folk,0,0,0,

everyone in the comments oh my god this is my last comment to you mate youll be a great politician one day im sure but im getting a bad taste in my mouth just by the way youre commenting i mentioned the entrance exam and the academic intelligence because in schools if you have that the teachers will treat you like gems so its embedded in us culturally that if youre someone who brings good grades youll get all the opportunities in life and some of these people literally behave like they own the world 0 humbleness and then they get humbled when they see others doing better than them or exceling in other fields which they initially thought was not the point since sports waale to mcdonalds me job karte hai na baad me one sentence someone from my school literally used go figure the solipsism starts to fade away and they learn later the way they should treat others go in the metro customer care or anywhere and see how they get angry at others think of anyone whos doing what perceived as a lower job as a low status person and treat them like shit ive seen fights where rich mothers made a ruckus just because they werent allowed into a bar 0 understanding and consideration that the other person can be a human being now do you get my point mr wrong perception i suggest you something seek first to understand in arguments or when you read posts like this rather than thinking oh the other person is absolutely wrong and stupid and let me change his perception this is also a huge thing with indians you act open and underconfident once and people attack you like youre the biggest idiot born on this planet its a discussion dude watch your language and then tell me youre not attacking me or maybe you just have a blindspot on how your words make people feel,0,0,0,

having lived in all the major metros i am more suitable to give the answer unfortunately i got to live in all the four zones of the country and can speak 8 languages let me explain the hatred that you are talking about specifically comes from people of delhi and not from other hindi speaking belts like up bihar rajasthan mp punjab bengal unfortunately the prejudice of kannadigas covers them all as one north indians for rude behavior of people coming from one city one level deeper why are delhites like this its the way they speak doesnt mean that they are rude these are people who have never worked in place where people have not known hindi this combined with a sense of entitlement status money materialistic things matter to them a lot hence the sense of entitlement and to see the other person lower down yes theres unconscious racism too but that has been generational its takes special lense to break such prejudices why these prejudices delhi has been one of the first capitalistic cities in india way before other metros other than mumbai as a result since the positive was that a lot of industrialization happened but also a lot of rich poor divide noker maalik relation prejudices came up also historically delhi has been at the crossroads of all the conflicts first place of all kinds of protests to start this constant struggle to find a place for themselves has resulted in the rudeness which you and i perceive theres nothing they can do about it unless its a superbly self aware person who is willing to change what this results into 1 looking poorly at someone who doesnt know the language hindi 2 sense of entitlement assuming that the other person would know hindi 3 the assumption that if they talk the same way as theyd talk in delhi it wont piss off the other person i have seen cab drivers get so frustrated internally because a person from delhi starts taking their own way instead of modulating the tone a little bit 4kannadigas perceive this as outright rude rightfully so because of the cultural differences and the inability to perceive that people are like that 5 this results in hatred for anyone who is found speaking in hindi this is also because of an average kannadigas prejudice lack of knowledge that hindi speaking people can come from different states conclusion its just a cultural difference why do north indians come here 1 job of course theres shitload of job scarcity in the country regardless of what you see in the media 2 sometimes bangalore remains the only hope for the country with startups providing jobs the sense of oneness is lost when we kannadigas think that only we should be staying here mumbai has not lost its marathi spirit and still keeps accommodating more and more north indians to this date bangalore is the next financial capital whether you agree or not its going to become one 3 kolkata has lost itself to communist ideology so much so that the people who are there will drag anyone down who is entrepreneurial 4 chennai its a biggest language barrier that there can be but the scenes are changing however thatll take at least 20 30 years for it to become cosmopolitan 5 pune doesnt have startup ecosystem but well set mncs so limitations of job opportunities there too 6 hyderabad closest competition to bangalore but its gonna take long time for them too 7 delhi ncr theyve done everything they can and they retain as many north indians there all governments have contributed to generate more opportunities there too so unlike the popular opinion not every north indian is flocking to bangalore conclusion lets all be mindful of each others behavior the fact is that people will move out eventually and therell people wholl come here to stay permanently whether you like it or not we should forget about the idea to getting bangalore to its green heaven retirees paradise that dream is long lost as for kannadigas their existence will never be threatened with or without them violently reacting to the situation a lot of north indians are respectful and considerate not because they are afraid but because thats their nature so being mindful will leave some room and time for understanding each other but considering what we are thats too much to expect i guess,0,0,0,

downvotes incoming we are in an age where globalization has taken over bengaluru back then bangalore had played a major role in boosting the indian economy and aptly earned the silicon city title and now the startup capital see industrialization has played a major role if the karnataka government back then chose to not open up there would have been almost no great development so credit to the government to opening up now that karnataka is a hub a lot of companies started opening up their branch here and also setting up so it is obvious these companies need skilled labor it is obvious they are going to look out for labors pan india it is obvious a lot of people come in from different parts of the country now when there is a surge of incoming population the existing ones always have the feeling that they have extended a part of them to outsiders which is a fair school of thought even developed countries like usa australia havestill has the exact same mentality when indians move there and take up their jobs so this is a very primal territorial behavior not just humans but animals as well but theres a difference between humans and animals humans are a lot more intelligent humans can choose to be civil unfortunately there are certain bad apples who resort to crude measures but for the better we are in 2023 now india as a whole has come along so ahead we are amongst the top economies in the world we have moved past the stage where language is a barrier it is sad to see such fights popping up in this beautiful city yes local natives can expect outsiders to learn the local language but no one has the right to pick up a fight to prove a point right instead teach a couple of words for basic communication why pick a fight this is intended only to the bad apples,0,0,0,
i will probably be downvoted but i will say it anyway the way i see it is kannadigas were too accomodating to the outsiders that outsiders took advantage of it now few people are realising that and trying to overcompensate by indulging in violence it is kind of like you have a guest come over to your house and you make him comfortable nothing wrong with that he became too comfortable and started taking decisions on how things will be at your house and now you feel like you are the guest in your own house,1,2,1,Karnataka

whatever the reasons and insights might be nothing justifies violence years ago in mumbai there was politically motivated violence against south indians especially those belonging to the shettybunts community the bunts community hit back big time in many ways mumbai being a melting pot and mumbaikars generally being unbothered by stupid political motivations in general didnt support the absurdness hopefully people in bangalore also strongly condemn this crap if there are north indians in bangalore there is a reason for it you cannot expect them to start speaking in kannada overnight when similar incidences happen to indians abroad we are mortified but heres us doing the same rubbish in our own country its shameful btw im a kannadiga,0,0,0,

im a mallu and lived most of my life in tamilnadu never had any bad experiences nor have i seen locals being hostile towards outsiders tamils are generally very polite and respectful of course they are proud and will take offense if you disrespect but ive never seen hostility and rudeness just because someone cant speak tamil mallus generally dont give a fuck about anything lol just dont tell us not to eat beef outsiders are not abused in kerala we generally do not care about your religion language or sex only ever seen people being offended for not asking directions in the local language in bangalore ive lived in bangalore for a couple of years first thing i remember was asking the conductor of a bus if itll go somewhere and him ignoring me dont tell me he didnt understand what i said im sure hes educated enough to understand will it go ive seen the same attitude from others as well the auto drivers the cab drivers and the shopkeepers etc surprisingly guys from north karnataka who are also here for work or for entrance coaching dont act like this i see that a lot of people say that this behavior is caused by unbridled kannada pride i beg to differ i believe it is jealousy and that too the stupid kind i kind of feel that the working class in bangalore feels that all these outsiders are coming in and reaping in all the cash earning millions while they the children of the soil have to toil for a pittance but the truth of the matter is that when i was at bangalore i was being paid 14k a month to do night shifts working at customer support listening to abuses and insults on call from jio customers 6 days work sometimes even longer since there are no fixed offs if any of the locals actually wanted to trade jobs i would have happily obliged lol compared to that being a cabbie sounds like a dream to people who say we dont put in the effort to learn the language when am i supposed to do that at night while i worked or in the day while i slept and how are we supposed to learn it from whom from the same hostile and rude guys who hate you for not knowing the language if you actually want people to learn your language and culture isnt it better to be friendly and kind instead of assaulting them if you really care about your language so much why dont you befriend a migrant worker and help himher learn the language but if you cant help at least stop harassing people life is a struggle for a lot of us as it is,0,0,0,

multiple things can be and are true it is bad to force immigrants to learn your language it is important to try to speak the local language if youre looking to make a new city your home it is unfair to expect locals to automatically know your language when you dont know theirs linguistic chauvinism is a problem in india language and often hindi imposition also is neither justifies the other in my experience the vast majority of kannadigas only expect that you try to speak the language no one expects that you speak it well many of the folks here know either hindi or english and if you try they do too there is nothing wrong with starting a conversation in kannada and then losing your way and switching languages later no one is under any obligation to try and that goes both ways commerce will demand that some conversations still get conducted only in the language of your preference but that cannot and does not mandate that that is welcomed karnataka also unfortunately has its fair share of idiots who use violence to deal with resentment condemn protest jail and root out the violence but understand the reason for the underlying resentment editing to add and the chauvinists can also get bent there is no favour youre doing our language by forcing someone to speak it and bullying a migrant worker whos trying to do an honest job to make ends meet does not make you a saviour of your language use your pride productively to help someone whos struggling to learn the language instead of driving people further away from it,0,0,0,

your opinions seem to contradict themselves you say kannadigas as the most liberal but you dont want the political views of the neighbouring states being shared here and it pisses you off if you go to kerala you will rarely find anyone shouting at you or beating you up for speaking hindi or english there is a sizable population of northern blue collared labours in kerala right now the business owners over there have started learning hindi so that they can converse easily with their staff if your mallu friends are asking you to learn a bit of malayalam its because you can share in their jokes as most of them dont translate well to other languages most of the mallus i know here speak fluent kannada and tamil there is no reasoning behind the violence against outsiders the fact that you are trying to find reasons just makes it worse,1,2,1,Kerala

so im a hard core kannadiga and grew up in an environment where everybody was a transplant i had friends who we tamilian malayalees and bengalis we didnt really see a lot of ethnicity or language issues but i have sense increased sense of kannadiga identity in the last 10 odd years my observations 1 in previous migrations people adapted the city as theirs and blended in even if not with language but in culture and customs no on imposes their identity on local population 2 the volume of migration was still small compared to local population now i think kannadiga population is in minority in lots of pockets 3 hindi as a language while we are learnt hindi was a national language down south this was just a theory personally i really dont see hindi as unifying language and it really userps the local identity imposing this both politically and in behaviour is actually annoying and ticks a lot of people off as kannadiga i thrilled if u can speak kannada but i am ok if you speak to me in english telugu tamil hindi but dont push me to speak your language so what makes bangalore great is its diversity violence is definitely not the answer we want people to co own this city lets us be the way we are and we will welcome you please dont make us change to your context,0,0,0,

im a kannadiga one of the major important factors that isnt talked about often is the failure of consecutive state govts to improve the rest of karnataka other than bengaluru and to some extent mysuru theres a lot of bitterness in north karnataka because it is often ignored and theres no significant effort from any govt to bring any industries or any infrastructure there guess where the majority of kannadigas live outside of metro cities just like any other state also compared to other states like tamilnadu and andhratelangana where theres importance placed on bringing manufacturing jobs other than it chennai has a lot of auto industries and hyderabad has a lot of pharmaceutical industries these jobs arent highly technical so they hire locally you bet a good mix of jobs this way while we just masturbate to the thought of bengaluru being such a major it hub without concentrating on anything else when you combine this major issue with the refusal of a few people to assimilage our language in their day to day lives you get racism misdirected hate and bigotry mark my words this will only get worse political parties have already found ways to take advantage of this by saying well impose quotas for kannadigas for it industry if they did their jobs and diversified our state then we wouldnt have had this issue in the first place,1,2,2,Karnataka

bro this is just pathetic bangalore is a metropolitan city and obviously people from all over india will come and work there even come for education and better life style which is completely natural you cant just expect everyone to learn kannada or claim that theyre not doing justice to the place itd make sense if entire karnataka is full of immigrants where therell be cultural and traditional practices lost over time here people are genuinely just looking to better their lives and opportunities are in very few places in the entire country in fact if it was not for all the immigrants the economy wouldnt be what you see right now im completely against forcing down your language down someones throat,0,0,0,
such group might be people or member from any kannada sangha or any kannada organisation the main intention of such people is spread awareness on importance of kannada language and such langauage should be mandatory according to them but i dont like such organisation because they brainwash the people with such messages forcefully they order them to follow kannada and i dont like their way of spreading awareness they want everything to be written in kannada like banners advertisement posters nameboard of shops temple and other place they strongly condemn non kannada freedom fighterspersanolaties like chatrapathi shivaji and others will take it off poster stickers etc anything related to that they are against right wings and i have watched many videos and post where they take action against such things there are many other things activities by them that i am not much aware of and i think they might be that group and apologize for such a brief explanation but i had to say whatever came to my mind instead they should amend the proper ways to spread awareness of kannada by teaching them by giving knowledge etc i dont know whether this words may hurt the sentiment of the kannadigas reading this comment if hurt i sincerly appologize from bottom of my heart even i know kannada but the place where i am working have north indian labours from up and assam even they learn little bit or basic kannada by listening to the others kannada conversation,1,2,1,Karnataka
violence is never the solution personally im not against learning the local language kannada but dont know how to learning a language is inherently very difficult that too as an adult 25 years age when you are dealing with too many things in your personalwork life you need to take special classes and make time to learn it there is no easily accessiblegovt sponsoredcommunity sponsored coaching that is run which people can join whenever they have time and make progress,0,0,0,
the problem is no large enough and distinct group of bangalorean left in the city and hence has no predominant culture which can claim they represent the whole city city is a microcosm of everything that is south indian from tamils malayalies telugus tulus north karnataka coastal karnataka etc they are so close to their native lands from bangalore ie within few hours of drive to make blr their cultural home while they do add to the segmented heterogeneity in the city but not mix with each other you can experience this first hand in pubs or rwa meetings of apartments hence unfortunately for bangalore its biggest asset its geographical location and weather has become its biggest obstacle in sustaining its culture it started when bangalores cosmopolitan citizens who were in their 20s and 30s migrated to west in 1990s and 2000s it revolution their families are now well settled there living a quite life there only connections to the city is old age parents or properties in jp nagar indira nagar or basveswarnagar etc very high growth of it industry meant they needed to double the headcount every 6 months in the 2000s and every 12 18 months in 2010s and with not enough native cultural leaders left in the city communities started developing ghettos based on languages who celebrated their own festivals or sometime just flying or drive back to their natives arrival of large numbers of middle class skilled workers from north and eastern parts of india as it companies cannot fill the demand from south indian states further diluted the culture today those who claim to be bangaloreans or kannadiga have no knowledge of the original cosmopolitan culture of the bangalore from 1970s to 1990s it is no longer the same city of 1980s and has same problems like any other metropolitan city in india,1,2,2,Karnataka

hijacking top comment to post a different perspective im a kannadiga one of the major important factors that isnt talked about often is the failure of consecutive state govts to improve the rest of karnataka other than bengaluru and to some extent mysuru theres a lot of bitterness in north karnataka because it is often ignored and theres no significant effort from any govt to bring any industries or any infrastructure there guess where the majority of kannadigas live outside of metro cities just like any other state also compared to other states like tamilnadu and andhratelangana where theres importance placed on bringing manufacturing jobs other than it chennai has a lot of auto industries and hyderabad has a lot of pharmaceutical industries these jobs arent highly technical so they hire locally you get a good mix of jobs this way while we just masturbate to the thought of bengaluru being such a major it hub without concentrating on anything else when you combine this major issue with the refusal of a few people to assimilate our language in their day to day lives you get racism misdirected hate and bigotry mark my words this will only get worse political parties have already found ways to take advantage of this by saying well impose quotas for kannadigas for it industry if they did their jobs and diversified our state then we wouldnt have had this issue in the first place,0,0,0,

i might have a reason or two for why not kannada 1 the daughter of the parents of the daughter might aspire for her to live in a developed nation knowing just english and french can help survive a lot of developed nations according to the 2022 report of the organisation internationale de la francophonie oif 409 million people speak french2 on the other hand kannada has 60 million speakers it has around 47 million native speakers and was additionally a second or third language for around 13 million nonnative speakers in karnataka this is a reason why lots ok kids study global languages than the regional ones they study for their future and they dont see kannada in their future this is what i understand from speaking to some friends whos children opted for french in schools icse and cbse offers kannada and hindi but not igcse which offers only hindi and french for languages afaik 2 leaning a language which uses the same latin script is a lot easier than leaning a much more harder language like kannada or japanese therefore more marks and a lot more time to study why should we fault them for this,0,0,0,

contrary to popular belief the majority of taxes collected in karnataka or india are handled by the central govt for example karnataka is second in terms of gst collection the taxes or funds are then diverted to state govts based on population so the high amount of taxes that are collected are not diverted to rest of karnataka but to the underperforming states in north india like up or bihar im not trying to divide north india and south india nor am i excusing the blatant mismanagement of funds and corruption thats present in the state govt i always considered myself indian first and kannadiga second which is why i hate coming on this sub cause i see my fellow indians hating on kannadigas and i see my fellow kannadigas hating on my fellow indians its not good for my mental health,1,1,1,Karnataka

my point is we are not here because we want to become kannadigas we are here to do a job grow in our careers and go wherever our careers take us the level of hypocrisy is unreal though you say you cant learn basic words in a local language to communicate on a day to day basis yet when you move to other countries youre willing to learn their language try saying the same thing when you go to germany or france or finland and see how youre treated besides speaking a few words in kannada doesnt make you a kannadiga,0,0,0,

no matter how much people deny it the ns divide is real these analyses by bbc and the economist explain the issue north indian states populations are rising while those in the south fall and theres 2 major consequences 1 under the gst regime high economic output southern states receive much less in federal transfers these are calculated based on population from the centre than they bring in through taxes the opposite holds true in impoverished high population states in the north bihar alone received 4 times more money than it brought in through taxes in the year 202021 its true that as a united nation prosperous states are obliged to help out poorer ones but after 75 years of independence these huge disparities are becoming harder to justify 2 if delimitation is carried out in 2026 the norths representation in parliament will jump by a huge margin while southern states will see their decisionmaking power eroded considerably since the north and souths opinions diverge on most political issues we already see this with the imposition of hindi by the bjp this could lead to a very unhealthy situation in the future edit this doesnt necessarily mean that india isnt united and that there isnt a sense of connection and common ground its just that the harsh socioeconomic realities will probably create problems in the future unless real change occurs,0,0,0,

you should read your post slowly the north south divide is huge on the internet and realistically you cannot form an informed opinion just by analyzing it as there are many troll accounts anyone on reddit can pose as an indian and shitpost or comment about anything and everything also judging by your post and the kind of words used somehow it gives the impression that you wanted to flame up emotions by using you people personally you seprate yourself from indians born and brought up in india and also by asking indians to work on issues youre just reaffirming yourself about your high status as a desi in united states at this point juding just by your post it is clear that you dont feel proud about your desi identity rather youre just here to spark a reaction and might also be farming some karma in the process no place is a shithole and underdeveloped countries are not shithole especially india which is now in its redevelopment stage after two hundred years of colonial rule there should be healing and there should be growth outside the internet most indians are nice to be around and living in europe i can confirm that,0,0,0,

developmental laggardness can largely be attributed to weak institutions thats it i dont necessarily consider institutions and culture to be independent they are both a product of each other the catholic church for example is an institution that creates culture the ayush ministry for eg in india is an institution created to serve rather dubious cultural practices why is it that south asian states have the weaker institutions than europe east asia and west asia historical inertia which i count as culture in china the central state would break into warring states and then unite again every few centuries this breakdown would cause the deaths of millions due to war and famine to prevent this from happening again and again the winning dynasty had to develop a strong state over millenium this led to very strong state a strong and effective state trains and hires competent workers based on merit china has been taking free for all civil servant exams for thousands of years most such standardised exams around the world especially british india were inspired by the chinese system observed during the colonial era you mightve noticed theres no concept of coaching preparation stress competition etc for standardised exams outside east asia and india you mightve also noticed all european and american universities have their own admission criteria and procedures they might be similar but you generally apply seperately for all which are not completely based on such crammy tests and are much more human oriented for the lack of a better term this was copied by vietnam korea and japan all these also copied rest of chinese culture they are more centralised and developed compared to countries who copied indian culture thailand bhutan indonesia etc europe has been playing clash of clans for 1500 years the decentralised fiefdoms all competed with each other in a free for all only the states with a strong centralised government survived this battle royale unlike china these states were relatively small and had to form cooperative federations to become big which is why europe has stronger local governments russia 1920s and germany 1870s went from the weakest to the strongest european powers after becoming more centralised in india it wasnt a free for all and nothing was based on merit everything was based on luck and family connections same as today only kshatriya caste could fight in wars and even they had to follow certain rules no room for innovation only vaishya caste was allowed to engage in industrial and commercial activities the type of goods they could makesell was restricted by sub caste there are no guns if theres no gun making caste very simplified ofc this is excellent for stability india has never had conflicts on the same scale as china or rome but after a point stability becomes stagnation there was no incentive to develop a strong state that could train and hire more and better workers based on merit all central govts even the british mostly just extracted wealth from their sub ordinates who would extract it from their sub ordinates the centre had no practical control over local matters again same as today very unlike china where the centre has power and europe taxation with services is the basis of a successful fief we see taxes more as feudal dues for which we get nothing in return they are reductionist and dont explain disparities like nk vs sk nogales arizona vs nogales mexico pakistani punjab versus indian punjab or himachal versus uttarakhand im not saying its the only factor im saying its the biggest difference between us africa east asia west asia middle east latin america and to a lesser extent se asia all but 1 of these suffered from colonialism partitionscivil wars barbarian turkic mongol arab etc invasions etc yet they are more developed than us ofc its reductionist but once you control for other factors such as geography colonialism wars and political arrangements its the only remaining factor our democracies theocracies communist dictatorships monarchies military dictatorships are all worse than theirs south asia is the worlds 2nd worst region after africa which has been plagued by wars and foreign interventions unlike most of indian subcontinent by all measures literacy income etc bihar and pakistan have worse social indicators than countries plagued by wars and terrorism like syria lybia and iraq how do you explain that hp vs uk is not a drastic difference it can probably be covered in 1015 years see maharashtra catching up to tamil nadu and punjab in hdi in the last 10 years even pakistani and indian punjab is not that huge of difference and i think it is fair to use other factors to explain this case since they are otherwise identical consider how much control nk has over its citizens can you imagine that in a south asian country otoh if you control for all other factors south asia seems mysteriously poor and undeveloped nogales difference is due to difference in spanish and britishamerican style of colonialism the spanish set up a feudal caste system which again did not provide any incentives to improve the britishamericans had a competitive capitalist system which provided an incentive to improve id consider it a result of difference between british and spanish culture during colonial times but even today spain lags behind uk in hdi and gdpcapita think about it this way no matter what party an mp or mla is from you as a normal person know not to mess with them how is that not culture its literally a common pattern of behaviour and belief in a population thats culture we dont mind nepotism in politics because hereditary positions are our culture we dont mind nepotism in hollywood and everywhere really because hereditary professions are our culture we dont mind segregation slums and gated communities because its our culture we dont mind throwing garbage because cleaning it up is someone elses job in our culture we dont mind a unequal and low level of education because its our culture earlier you had relatively a few highly educated brahmins and large illiterate masses now you have a few iitians doctors and iimians and large barely literate masses china chose to build primary schools for all before building universities for many we built universities for a few iit iisc aiims pgi etc and left the primary schooling upto your parents if your parents can afford that then you get those few prestigious universities 2 core people give board exams iits iiits and nits only

its a night and day difference and you know it inequality exists in all countries dveeloped and undeveloped yet the level of disparity that exists in a place like kerala let alone poorer states like bihar or much richer developing countries like turkiye thailand and china doesnt exist in developed countries a simple example is drinking water drinking water from a faucet is unsafe everywhere in india this means everyone needs to spend a decent chunk of money on buying bottled water or energy to boil water a middle class indian redditor might not realize but this becomes a massive cost when a daily wage laborer earns maybe a couple thousand rupees a month on top of that this has an impact on child mortality as unclean water doesnt mix correctly with baby formula and unclean water can transfer diseases to children if kerala cannot guarantee safe drinking water the most basic of human needs it is not developed btw this does not happen in 999 of the us and the one time a situation like this happened in flint mi heads rolled and a state of emergency was declared yet a flint mi type state of emergency over unclean water is just a normal day anywhere in india and tbf almost all of asia excluding japan south korea singapore and taiwan the fact that someone in kerala can hire a maid for pennies on the dollar is another notable example the only reason you can do that is because millions of people in india are living a hand to mouth existence where even getting a meal for the night isnt a guaruntee you might tell me that these people are migrant workers and that makes it even worse in the us we get plenty of migrant workers as well legal and illegal yet it is impossible to commit this kind of labor abuse in the us without getting caught and going to jail for human trafficking look at the devyani khobragade incident for example on top of that those migrant workers in america are still entitled to basic rights like free internet affordable connectivity free water its a default tap water is safe a 3001000month food subsidy snap or state level equivalent free medical insurance medicaidaca etc with no questions asked about residency status on top of that the worst govt hospitalsregional medical centers in the us would make aiims delhi or apollo look like a torture chamber ive personally told a congressman fuck you to their face as a professional event and havent been impacted if i did the same to an mp or mla from any party in india id be lying in a ditch somewhere there are thousands of daily occurrences in kerala and the rest of india that simply do not exist in developed countries rationalize all you want you know im right why else does amit shahs sisters both live in chicago and rahul gandhi attended american universities arun jaitleys niece attending the same public high school i did and all the children of ias officers mps from all parties of india and elite businesspeople go to the same average uc as i did,0,0,0,

"I am from chhatisgarh , and first of all thank you for addressing the problems and talking about our state ❤

Some more problems that i feel are :-

• Few politicians giveaway liquor in villages to gain their vote and encourage them to consume alcohol as it stands as a great market there .This mainly increases alcoholism.

•Problem of illiteracy is also because of arrogant and bad behaviour of students in small towns. As teachers are ready to teach in each language and most schools now have better facilities but the students and parents of villages themselves are not ready to educate themselves.

•Also problem is of politicians considering Chhtisgarh as ""Gaon"" always and people seeing chhatisgarh as backward state that is absolutly not true . Cities such as Raipur , Bilaspur , Bhilia , etc are well developed and others can also be if you work on it. 

• General category and middle class of chhatisgarh is always ignored. ( all the schemes are for tribal communities)

•Naxalism is not a such big problem now. It is exaggered to push down other problems

And you did a great job on this video but i think when you talk chhatisgarh its not only about village and tribals iamges its also about cities and other castes.

Thankyou .",1,3,3,Chhattisgarh

"Hello sir, I've been following you for quite some time.
I'm from Bhilai, Chhattisgarh 
And the major problem I see is over consumption of alcohol, drugs, lack of educational awareness, connectivity 
And self awareness in the youth they are simply not interested in doing anything.
Youth from developed districts like Raipur, Bhilai-Durg, Bilaspur is making nation proud in various aspects but on the other hand many of our juniors are sadly still trapped in the vicious cycle of alcohol consumption.

I feel that one problem here is that whatever develepment is happening here is only happening in 3 to 4 districts ( like Raipur , durg , Bhilai ) rest  of the districts are still the same no growth is visibale there.

"First of all, I want to thank you for creating such an engaging and thought-provoking video about Chhattisgarh and its challenges. It’s refreshing to see someone addressing these issues with depth and clarity. Being a resident of Chhattisgarh, I deeply appreciate your effort to start this much-needed conversation.

While I agree with most of the points you raised, I’d like to share a few additional insights, especially about the portrayal of Naxalism and its implications for the state’s image.

Naxalism:

It’s true that Naxalism remains a challenge, but the way it is portrayed in media often paints an exaggerated picture of the issue. While it impacts specific districts, many parts of Chhattisgarh are thriving and remain untouched by this problem. Unfortunately, this blanket portrayal of the state as a ""Naxal-affected region"" discourages investments, tourism, and even local development efforts.

Moreover, it’s worth considering how the ""Naxal state"" tag benefits certain political and bureaucratic circles. By maintaining this narrative, some leaders seem to leverage the issue as a tool to justify underdevelopment or corruption in other sectors. This persistent branding not only hampers Chhattisgarh’s progress but also stalls any significant push to truly resolve the issue.

State Branding and Image:

One of the major reasons Chhattisgarh doesn’t receive the attention it deserves is its outdated and negative branding. The focus always remains on problems like Naxalism, but little is done to highlight the state’s rich cultural heritage, industrial potential, or natural beauty. Changing this narrative requires proactive efforts from both the government and civil society to showcase the positive aspects of Chhattisgarh on national and global platforms.

Brain Drain:

Another point you touched on briefly—youth migration—is something I see as a double-edged sword. While it’s true that the brightest minds often leave the state for better opportunities in cities like Bengaluru or Pune, I believe this brain drain stems from a lack of focused development in urban infrastructure and professional opportunities within the state. Addressing this requires a shift in policy to make cities like Raipur and Bilaspur hubs for education, technology, and entrepreneurship.

Concluding Thoughts:

Your video is a great starting point to spark discussions around these issues, and I deeply appreciate your effort to shed light on these challenges. It’s high time we, as citizens, take a proactive role in changing the narrative around Chhattisgarh—whether it’s by highlighting untapped opportunities, questioning outdated narratives, or holding accountable those responsible for perpetuating them.

Thank you again for your work. I hope more people join this conversation and help shape a brighter future for Chhattisgarh.",1,3,5,Chhattisgarh

"The problems you discussed are true 
But you discussed corruption and other situations worsen in last 5years under congress 
You don't know the BJP'S Raman Singh sarkar which ruled for 3-4 sessions before this. It was the most corrupt government and a big reason why chhatisgarh couldn't develop because those years were peak of development in every other states.
Also , you should have mentioned atmanand schools opened by Congress govt. Which are  newly opened/ renovated govt schools which have good infrastructure",1,2,5,Chhattisgarh
"Not everything in this video is accurate, also your video sounds one sided. I think you really need your research more and more and before stating any point or showing any image you should really consider the impact it will have on others. 
You said in 1 point that Chhattisgarh only has digitalisation in only 50% of the areas, but you forgot that many districts in Chhattisgarh are like villages and villagers are not into digitalisation because of there routine and lifestyle. No doubt that awareness is important and things like liquor consumption should be stopped or controlled and schools and education should be prioritised but less influence of city life has kept the cultural aspect of Chhattisgarh very strong. Tribal people practice their culture and traditions which really keeps the authenticity or uniqueness of a state alive.

I am from Chhattisgarh and i have travelled to most of the districts, reality is different than what has been described in the video.",1,2,3,Chhattisgarh

"Madhya Pradesh is below average in every aspect from it's GDP to the living standrds to basic amenities/ facilties available here. I am domicioe of MP and a resident of Bhopal and Bhopal is the worst capital in the entire world, worst than even the most unlivable city of pakistan. The electricity, roads, public sanitisation and basic amenities in Bhopal are probably comparable to that of the poorest of African countries, and all that is thanks to Shivraj Singh Chouhan of MP.  Evry city and township of MP (except for Indore) is in tatters, with really the worst living conditions, there's extraoordinary levels of corruption everyhwere and the most wealtisest of non business folks in MP are the government employess sitting on higher positions of power, everybody else is poor or below average when it comes to the financial capacity and livings standards of the comman man. Electricity supply has always been a major drawback of MP state as there's no one day when the electric supply isn't cut off, in fact it happens several times a day, even at the heart of it's political centre i.e. Bjopal city (except for the regions in the city where the political and administrative class resides). They keep buying new busses here but within just short span most of them are turned into a junk, the roads are undrivable on, they arfe only once maintened every 5 years, right before the elections, the jobs offered at the govt offices are all to the appeased communities so the corrupotion levels in the civic bodies and law enforcement agencies is at it's extreme here in MP. I think that even pakistan, kangladesh and Nepal have a much higer living standards than Madhya Pradesh and this is what people usually call the ""GARH"" or ""FORT"" of BJP but in reality Madhya Pradesh is the money minting mine of BJP. Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the former BJP chief miinister has become a billionaire along with his close friend Dilip Con builder, who was twenty years ago just a very small community constructor in Mandideep, a small and once undersdeveloped satellite township near Bhopal. Dilip Con became a billionaire literally and he also holds the corruption money stolen by Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who literally sucked this MADHYA PRADESH state dry and turned it evem more poorer than it earlier was. Can't right wnough and can't say enough how BJP has actually been a curse on Madhya Pradesh (I used to be a hardcore BJP supporter but I still support it to some extent only due to Naqrendra Modi ji).

(It's 200 btw in Indore). Apart from this, roads of the state are in heavoc. Even in the top city of MP which is Indore (not Bhopal even though it's the capital), the roads are like village roads, cracks and potholes, even the newly constructed roads are like that. So roads are definitely a problem but the MP govt approves a lot of funds on roads, which the corrupt people automatically consume. IT sector can actually boom in MP, especially in Indore as it is developing at a very fast pace and the quality of life here is also peaceful compared to other big cities so yeah it's a thing which can be worked on. IDA should allot a lot more land to big IT companies at low price so they can setup more of there offices in the state. MP has a lot of tourist places, but they are not properly maintained and promoted like they do in Rajasthan. It should be done here too. Gwalior and the regions near it have forts and palaces. Sanchi stupa is here as well which is an international historical site and than there's also wild life sanctuaries but they aren't promoted which is a shame. MP can become the tourist capital of India even if not the industrial capital. One thing is MP should revive it's clothing mills which used to biggest in the country at one point.

One of the worst aspects of Madhya Pradesh is that it is a BJP-ruled state, which has proven harmful because there is no political diversity—only one party remains in power, which has deeply corrupted the state.

The people of MP are very innocent, often voting for any party or candidate, only to regret it later, as the state is rife with political corruption, and almost every politician engages in it.

The state's progress has been held back by illiterate or older leaders, and no new, younger candidates come forward in politics. Politics in the state lacks the rationality that is sorely needed.

There is also a high level of crime in Madhya Pradesh, though many cases go unregistered. For instance, even today, the Chambal area has a lot of crime, and the historical background of Chambal and MP is well-known, as the crime there has severely hindered the state’s progress.

The only solution is to bring in some corporate work culture, attract new companies, foster good leadership in politics, and reduce the state’s dependence on agriculture.",1,1,4,Madhya Pradesh
"Thanks for making this video!

Being a MP resident would like to point out a few things

1) The data you presented is a bit outdated: Urbanization data seems really outdated, we might not have any tier-1 city but we have clustered urban centres. In recent times central govt has indeed facilitated good institutes for education
2) I felt the road density being less is directly a result of close to 40% of area under forest cover
3) The forest cover has decreased in last few years which is really concerning for us residents. We value slow peaceful and happy life more, rather than having destruction led industrial growth
4) Scams in govt jobs are indeed a big prevailing problem but that's also a problem across India
5) Same with corruption and political leaders personal growth, a nationwide issue eating up resources 
6) In last decade MP has been able to develop basic infrastructure which was absent for the longest time.
7) I always wondered as a kid why MP is never in news and I assure you Congress never did any project when they were in power. BJP too worked only for basic infrastructure which is good but the rate is slow
8) I don't think being an Agrarian economy is bad, per capital income in MP might be less but if we adjust for purchasing power parity I think MP is one of the cheapest to live in",1,3,3,Madhya Pradesh
"Seeing comment section one thing i can tell people of mp want peaceful life and happy with current condition but i think human nature never ever happy with current condition and its goes with state too 

 Mp needs more sustainable development like road infrastructure with wildlife and environmental consideration like ( pench national park over bridge road ) and  tribal tourism with home stay can inhance literacy and development to the core and deep forest mp .

 Manufacturing also important with agriculture like food processing industries too Boost economic growth 


Mp needs new startup policy in agriculture  and service sector  lead to resolve unemployment issue in mp with the help od skilled education and training 


Govt should focus on every part of the state not only wertern mp nowadays i can see more projects and scheme  helps development in plane western part but mp has wast geography hilly regions in northern part too

"MP is literally a great state; yes, it is a little under development, but believe me, there is so much peace in here. Bhopal is all about love; here people love to help others even when you are from other states. You will never feel alone here. Cultural programs are also very good.

Hence, the only thing here is that employment opportunities are not great, and salaries are also low. The education system is normally like a tier 2 or tier 3 college, so placement opportunities are not great. Infrastructure, specifically hospital numbers, is low in rural parts of MP. 

But if you want to live a very simple life, then MP is heaven; it is underdeveloped.Here people are modern but also connected with cultural roots, not living a materialistic life.

From what I think mp need to creat awareness more in political matters rather than follow any leader blindly or manipulatively because of that we lack in forming the oppotion and most importantly mp has mostly uneducated and unemployed people who doesn't show any interest in political matter either they hate it or blindly support it just based on there religious performances and that's the biggest issue because that the work of governance and administration is lacking people not even getting rights and even they are not even aware of it they saw all of thus things with there own but still decided to shut because of fear of upper hand powers people of mp either manipulated or take no interest in politics anymore,1,1,2,Madhya Pradesh

But they do not diversify these funds to different states and sectors.... Which debalances the states development rate.. MP state also have very slow speed of developing infrastructure as metro projects, flyover and state highways..  Poor transportation connectivity between production houses textile areas and districts...

"Adarsh Gupta, either you are unaware or ill informed 
FYI Madhya Pradesh was worst during Congress era or Arjun Singh and Digvijay Singh!!!!
It's an ""Average"" state and please be informed that until 2005 it was in BIMARU category 
Categorize the state properly and then mention the video 
Madhya Pradesh needs to have large industry as well as service sector jobs(IT/BPO) on a large scale.
Having mentioned this the state has tremendous potential for Historcal/Religious plus Nature/ Wildlife tourism and needs to highlight them more 
Historic plus Religious places like Gwalior, Indore, Ujjain, Dewas, Khajuraho, Bhopal need to be developed, and did you know Pachhmarhi hill station? Bhimbetka caves? Bhedaghat?
The Wildlife tourism has more potential than any other state 
Kanha, Pench, Panna , Bandhavgarh, Satpura - 5 Tiger reserves all of them beautiful!!!
Kuno National park and National Chambal Gharial sanctuary 
The state was pulled out of poverty by none other than Shivraj Singh Chouhan by focus on agriculture growth along with tourism however now other sectors need to be focused 
The economic growth stagnated around 2018, however BJP is still the option for Congress is worst here
The state lacks coastline 
The strategic location may help as it can focus on warehouse and storage place it being in the centre of India 
Development needs to go beyond Indore, Ujjain, Bhopal Jabalpur and Gwalior to places like Betul, Seoni, Katni etc
The basic amenities such as electricity water and roads (BSP as it was called then)have improved since 2000s and it needs to be done in remote rural areas

"MP has unlimited minerals, various flora and fauna, hefty solar-hydraulic & wind renewal sources, various agricultural activities and various tourist places . Now I tell you the worst part is Poor education system. No jobs after graduation. In each and every department only outsource employees are working. All departments are corrupt whatever big contractors or relative of politicians said they only follow there guidelines. 
Work culture of 2 big bodies (MPPSC and MPPEB/VYPAM) are very very slow. 
Government to show its fake credibility try to release recruitment notification at an interval of 2-3 years. Only for third grade jobs like Police constable, Patwari and Shikshak bharti. And for Doctors-Engineers and other gazetted post you need to wait for an interval of 3-5 years in MP. Here please keep in mind only recruitment notice means only form fill-up dates so that government can earn huge exam fees from all unemployed students of the state and utilize this amount for their growth that is elections and then they as usual forget to conduct exam. If in case by mistake exam held successfully then they forget to release result or alternatively announcing that paper leaked in xyz place and they announce re-exam will conduct soon. If in case result released then they forget to give joining letter. And might be then they checked how many of them (students) are still interested because in this long waiting period n-number of candidates do suicide or for searching jobs migrate from MP to other states.

So everything going as usual. Fact and the truth is, MP never got a visionary leader like Vivek Tankha, who has a strong hold in central and vision to bring M.P out from its old culture.

"I am a happy citizen of Vidisha (Madhya Pradesh).

I believe there are two aspects to development that need to be considered. As shown in this video, we are below the national average in terms of urbanization, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Many people in Madhya Pradesh prefer living peacefully in their villages, where they have everything they need to survive. 

It's important for others to understand that MP plays a crucial role in providing food security to India. What's the point of industrial growth if we don't have food to eat? In a war like scenario where other countries impose sanctions on us, imagine the situation without MP’s agricultural contribution.

We value living in harmony with nature, and we don’t want a concrete jungle. Our forests, less traffic, more greenery, the sacred Narmada river, and the Mahakal temple are all part of our peaceful way of life. While tribal populations are declining in other parts of India, in MP, they are thriving without discrimination—this is what true humanity looks like.

If we want to boost the state's GDP, the central government should consider removing export bans on agricultural commodities. For example, the MSP of wheat in 2024 is ₹2,125. Imagine how much the price could increase if we were allowed to export wheat freely.

Of course, there are challenges, but we have a strong foundation in MP. We have peace, we have food, and we are building on that.

Started construction of metro in Bhopal,Indore.
In rural areas he have done great work to uplift many people out of poverty.

MP have highest forest area in India. What more do you want?",1,2,3,Madhya Pradesh
"As a person from indore 
I will agree cities like Indore and bhopal are booming but rest of mp is left behind there is lack of industrial setup in the rest of mp as  its tribal and remote with lack of connectivity and lack of expressways 
But aadarsh I would like to correct you forests are not a burden it's the heritage of madhya pradesh those forests are the reason we are the tiger state the leopard state the wolf state of india they contain a lot of flora and fauna but the main thing they do is that they provide and hold water for the state for harsh dry summers without them I am sure this state would be drought prone as mp doesn't have rainy western ghats or perennial rivers like maharashtra and UP
So I would disagree that mp doesn't need that much forest cover 

The point I feel should have been discussed more was that the reason of mps lack of development is its corrupt politicians 
In the time of digvijays govt he tore and ate the state peice by peice he n his ministers did the state so much injustice that the state was in shambles then came the bjp govt with promises which they fulfilled mostly to a certain extent but they were corrupt behind that mask either it may be vyapam it may be sand mafia bjp was less corrupt but still did the state injustice 
And now mohan Yadavs govt is just a puppeteer in the hands of center but congress is unable to provide a better alternative so I won't be surprised if this govt continues 
Lack of clean opposition is eating this state as both the parties are involved in corruption sand mafia has both bjp n cong vyapam had both bjp n cong 
The point I would like to tell u about is lack of good institutions are govt doesn't give a look upon the education in govt sector and in private sector all the colleges are of mafias and people with a lot of black money which are supported by the govt 
Every single pvt college has a huge fund from some politician like digvijay shivraj kailash vijayvargi etc etc and that's why those colleges are care free they won't be shut down ever they don't provide good education and they literally rob the students with a lot of fees n provide no valuable education",1,2,4,Madhya Pradesh

Ans :
1.Education -all college owned by  minister ,no study only pay fee.
2.industry- all minister are not welling to make industries because all people making desi cigrate (bidi).
3.forestory-MP provide oxygen to all india so not cut forest land.
4.politics- every home have 1 neta ,thatsby no work for social policy.
5.jobs -world biggest scam job vypam only neta reletive have govt job.
6.casteism -biggest problem in mp ,many discrimination in job ,land, office's etc
And final conclusion is.............
Free bees politics is best for mp people, no objection for road ,schools, college,job,street light , drainage.

Zabardasti ka criticism. There are few challenges. But the situation is much more better than earlier. Every state cant be top state. You didnt even cover real issue. Which is mp being a central state do not have any coast to develop port or border to trade.

For example Gujarat was ruled by both Congress and BJP yet very developed.. similarly Maharashtra. Tamil Nadu was never ruled by both Congress and BJP yet very developed.

3. Public sector have very high corruption in MP specially Police & electricity department. 

4. I come from rural area and there is no awareness about organic farming in MP because we all know if we continue chemical farming then our land will not be that fertile after 100-200 years and  we will lose ground water level as well this should be point of focus.

"I am from MP first of all thanks for making this video, almost the entire nation ignores out states they just assume that we are very backward people and only tribals and dacoits live here.

The education system sucks in madhya pradesh,
i did my schooling from a cbse school but the condition of MP board is really bad, i saw their 12th class exam paper and they're asked who invented light bulb in a 5 mark question, who is President and prime minister etc.
If a person can score 50% in CBSE he can score 90+ in state board.
The teachers dont come to classes, the english teacher dont know the meaning and pronunciation of the words she is teaching.
And in my village majorty of the kids complete their education even some are graduates and then they work in medical shops as labour.

I did my college from RGPV Bhopal and i must say that sucks too we dont have to go to college, exams are complete fraud if teacher is on good mood he will give you marks for doing nothing and if he isn't in the mood they wont give you any marks no matter how well you perform.
since they get money based on number of sheets they check they just check them really fast to increase their income.

And lastly my father is a farmer and conditions of farmers is really bad govt doesn't give any good price for the crops and same goes with business owners.
My dad invested 60K in cotton farming and earned 55K only and from that too we have to pay the labours and the all our hardwork goes into vain.",1,2,3,Madhya Pradesh

This can be done through collaboration between State Government & Niti Aayog. Infact State can establish its own Niti Aayog where this body will help plan a roadmap for Social & Economic Development of the State.

"Being from Jabalpur ,i would say that MP mein concentrated development bahut jyada hoti hai , rural areas ko jyada se jyada agriculture related development milti hai aur nothing else , major development 4 badi cities me hi hoti hai aur usme bhi sabse jyada focus indore bhopal aur gwalior me hota hai , jabalpur even being a judicial capital isko bahut jyada neglect kara jata hai don't know why , jo special economic zone aapne bataye usme 6 mese 5 indore me hai, Kaha hi hogi development ese . As foretold i'm from jabalpur iss side bilkul dhyaan nahi diya jata hai . Poore east MP me sirf jabalpur hi ek Major city hai , aur inhone yaha pe bhi ek international airport tk nhi banaya hai , nearest international airport humare ko nagpur ka padta hai , indore bhopal bahut door hai eastern mp se . MP ke paas vaise hi Paisa nahi tha aur ab iss baar freebie politics hone lagi on a extreme scale. But one thing i would say MP ke even development ke liye shivraj singh se jyada mujhe kamalnath capable lagta hai, kyunki vo hai chhindwara ka , unke regime me development dekhi hai humne east MP me ( mai east mp isliye mention karra hu kyunki yaha ki halat sabse jyada kharab hai) . Mp me govt ko agriculture par focus to karna hi chaiye par sath sath industries aur service sector par bhi dhyaan dena chaiye par iska mtlb ye nahi ki Sirf indore bhopal , har part me honi chaiye , tbhi kuch hoga vrna esehi reh jayega MP ,kabhi develop nhi hopayega",1,2,4,Madhya Pradesh

"I really don't comment but this was needed here , my first experience of mp was so bad that I won't suggest any Indian to travel at that place. As i entered mp guys you won't believe a damp, negative,low kinda vibe entered and feeling was shit. If you see near by you won't be able to see a single human ,animal all you can see is some trees that are dry and barren land . Food was totally pathetic and places are not developed. There is no culture kind of thing of you see as they speak Hindi which is a new language not that old. Bhopal ,itarsi,bina,guna,multai,all these places look one and the same no proper system and old stations kind of boring. Mp has no vibe whatsoever you won't feel the home kind of feeling there. As i  was travelling i also went to jhansi,agra and mathura vrindavan,delhi etc and only thing i can say is mp,up,bengal, chattisgarh, jharkhand,bihar,delhi,punjab, haryana are the worst places in india would not like to suggest anyone. People are worst and shit also food is totally crap. Delhi is more of a gundaraj and lootera capital rather than national capital people are money minded and chutiyas also Delhi is shit nothing new just old British era houses given to gov emp and all corruption loving and freebies staying in delhi. Worst places of all is up,bihar,delhi,mp never ever go there. Man i really admire south india some times its atleast not like north people are atleast helpful and good in terms of education. These fools from up,bihar,mp come to other states and behave as if they are intelligent and belong to neew york😂 if you see mp up and that entire north belt then you understand they are nothing but poor people who don't have any lifestyle.",1,3,2,Madhya Pradesh
"Being from mp trust me its not that bad as it sounds. Most of us are in comfort just not touching the benchmarks others has set. If you have travelled in trains for up bihar you know how jam packed they are and people sleep anywhere in it seen this condition in all over india but not that bad for mp.compare to up bihar. Now the thing is agricultural sector has only improved in last two decades. But we often forget one main reason we are developing at slow pace and it is the largest forests cover by a state we are no. 1. And have big tribal population which cant be removed because of laws and deforestation is not that easy here can be done in other state easily but not here. An industrial corridor was proposed in mp which can boost economy of central eastern districts of mp but it was passing through forests so it is diverted to central already established highways which has already seen damage. No other big state have two big mountain range in middle of it like vidhyachal and satpura range pass through mp not like western or easten ghats passing from side of state, instead these two central range made it hard to damage it and form industries here. Yet we are mostly good not having natural disasters, hot temperature, border issue, immigration, riots, yeap we have many issues but we are developing at slow pace atleast we are not building another delhi and mumbai we are slow but with proper development nahi toh bana do delhi sab tabha karke ,.laga do.logo.ko.mumbai ki tarah dakke mukki ki zindagi me or yeap.we need to free from.corruption these local authorities always eat the money for the development of cities but yeah middle-class family is paying less electricity bill if use under the unit.,. Mmvy scholship.is really helpful for many students. Even bhopal is situated on 5 or 7 hills and with lakes its not easy to put industries eveywhere. Bjp govt had worked for farmers as it is evident as the agri growth but no that great in other sector maybe a better vision can change it. And we are also not that developed as mp.does have any preestablished city strengthen economically by britishers nor the state was formed by a well established reason like.langauge or culture just residual of other states formed together so no big politicals games played here so people can atleast subconsciously made politicians under pressure for any same cause like other state some fight for their language or food or culture mp.share its border wtih five states without any united culture then impacted by what there previous engaged state or say neighbouring state",1,3,4,Madhya Pradesh

I also suggest people going to south india from north india to speak very politely to south indian brothers/sister. They are kind people and believe in helping you out but if you act like an ass definitely you will not receive any response or respect. When i was in Karnataka, even though i was not good in kannada and english, i was able to talk with them in hindi and get my work done. What helped me was whenever i talked to them i always tried to learn kannada words and meaning from them. This attitude helped me a lot and latter i was even able to learn understanding kannada as well as  speak english. Though i was not proficient in kannada but could speak enough to sustain normal conversations. Your attitude, politeness, and behaviour will always help even if you are not knowing the language.

U know in a government organisation in Delhi.dwaraka I faced the same problem.the security standing there told me if u speak English it's not going to work this is dvarka speak hindi.. ithr hindi me baath kr
Then i called the official and started speaking in English.
After standing there for hours.

U know the so called uneducated brutes also exist in your place in mass numbers.
If u take a census u can find more such people in north than in Kannada or entire South.
U first better educate your uneducated brutes first .
Because kannadigas are more educated than u northies .
First of all let me say I am not from Kannada.
I am from kerala.
I never faced issue from kannadigas.
Meanwhile kannadigas speak to me in malayalam.
I know kannadigas who speak in Tamil malayalam English hindi and kannadiga.

It's only that if you don't show your Aryan supremacy they will just be comfortable  speaking to u in whatever language .

And when they say please learn our language try to learn it.
Not just show your supremacy there.
When u ask us why don't u speak hindi .its a different thing u are asking bhoshadike why not speak in hindi.

And in hindi speaking places speaking English is like a sin😂😂😂.
U know they would just make u feel like u are a Britisher😂😂😂.
While when the British comes hindi guy would support his ass.

That's the tone.
When a kannadigas see u he is asking will u learn kannadiga that's an educated request",1,2,2,North-India

then he started to scold me in kannada. he locked my bike and abusing in his kannada language and forcing me to speak in kannada.

first time i felt that i am not staying in india.
i understood some kannada language.....
he was saying that,
you are staying on kannada land, (haha paying 12000rs rent/month)
you are drinking kannada water, (hahaha paying 40rs/15L can)
you are eating kannada food.(hahaha  paying approx 10k for food to my family)

"Why North and Central Indians find it difficult to understand Keralites? There are several reasons. The obvious one is language- Hindi and Malayalam are totally different. Bollywood has played its part from 1960s to downgrade the image of a Mallu or Tamilian (with the typical cheap comedy of AyAyyo Sirji Hum Pillai Nagarangamuthuswamy). 
Kerala is a communist state, which doesn't sit well with the notion of a democratic North India. 
Kerala didn't really have to struggle historically in battles from external powers that mainly engaged and ruled North India 
Keralites (in Middle-East especially) are not liked. They are known to form clusters amongst themselves (one guy can bring 100 people from his village to Middle east) and to act as a termite when working for non-Keralites (siphon money or resources/ put obstacles for others) 
Keralites, in general, can be easily dominated or intimidated by others. Rarely you will find them standing up for themselves as they like to remain away from confrontation. This is in contrast to a Punjabi, UPite or Rajasthani who are either Jat or Rajput and are used to dealing with confrontational situations from generations.
Keralites feel that others are jealous of them - this cannot be farther from the truth. Certainly there is no one is jealous of them. 
Rarely you will find a Keralite who is happy for others - it is just not part of their culture. 
They take lot of pleasure in talking in Malayalam in front of a non-mallu. 
People from North do refer to Malayalees as Tamilian which is not fair to either of them. They are totally different people with slightly common language and looks.
In general, people from other parts of India do not respect Keralites as much as they should for one reason or another - language, looks, attitude, politics, behaviour, Bollywood. 
To top it all off Tamilians killed Rajiv Gandhi in 1991. Everyone still hates them for that. LTTE were rightly labelled as terrorists and this was very well highlighted by John Abraham in Madras Cafe.

Kannadigas: How long have u been in Bengaluru?
Non Kannadigas: 2 Years now..
Kannadigas be like: Shit the fuck up and leave.. 
3) Why do we need to know Kannad.? Kannada people can speak so many LANGUAGES. And what's with the culture. Hahahha
Kannadigas: You ass, we learnt ur language to respect u guys and to make u feel at home. We welcomed u with open arms to respect u and ur culture and ur disrespecting our culture. Buzz off dickhead. 
4) Kannadigas do not accept others, they're not open minded. And Bengaluru and ur state KA has developed because of us. 
Kannadigas: Ass.. Its because Kannadigas are open minded that Bengaluru today is a metropolitan city. Its because they allowed other cultures to come in that non Kannadigas are in a 49.5 perc population in Bengaluru and are all living in harmony and peace today. 
B'luru was always the home to IISC, Public sectors like BEL, HAL, BEML, BHEL and so on. It was always called the Garden city for its beautiful parks. It was the safest city in the 
country and the last city in the list of crime rates (before the IT revolution). Bengaluru's contribution to India in cricket, science, arts, music is enormous. Bengaluru musician Ricky Kej won Grammy for India. Wipro is a Karnataka company. The company that brought the new breeze of IT was Infosys. Padmabhushan Dr.
Narayana Murthy & Kannada writer Padmashri Dr.Sudha Murthy are proud Kannadigas. Founder of Cafe Coffee day across India Mr Siddhartha is a Kannadiga. MTR is a Karnataka company 
by a Kannadiga. Ours was the best city before IT revolution. It continues to be even after non locals started coming to the city. We aren't insecure nor are we dependent on anyone. 
Bengaluru has contributed not only to itself but also a lot to the whole nation. All the great guns in major fields have people from Karnataka.

5) I didn't know Kannada film industry makes good films. I watched KGF and loved it.
Kannadigas: Know facts and do ur researches first u idiots. Kannada industry is an industry that started many 'firsts' in Indian Cinema. first underwater film of Indian cinema - Kannada(ondhu mutthina kathe).. first bond movie of Indian cinema - kannada(jedara bale) first south film to be shot outside India- kannada(africadalli sheela).. first actor from India to win doctorate- kannada(Dr Rajkumar sir ) only Indian actor to win prestigious kentucky colonel award which was earlier awarded to the British and Russian prime ministers only-kannada(Dr rajkumar Sir).the first a South Indian film to collect 65cr (Mungaru Male) with budget of 75lakh...The first slow motion song in India - Dr Vishnuvardhan Sir's Baare Baare from Kannada film Nagarahavu. The first Director to bring an international award for a nationwide popular TV series Malgudi Days (A proud Kannada superstar and director Shankarnag Sir). The only Indian Film to win more than 45 international awards with Hollywood director Francis Koppola (of a godfather fame) talking about the film: THITHI (Kannada).... Ravichandrans premaloka in late 80s and Dr Vishnuvardhan Sir's Cult classic Muthina Haara in early 80s were made with a budget of 1.75 crore each. Premaloka became a huge massive hit collecting that huge amount even in 80's where even bollywood weren't producing films in that budget. Manirathnam, balumahendra got a break from Kannada films. Kannada FILM Industry is located in the South Indian state of Karnataka, the state that grows highest Sandalwood in India. Like Hindi Film Industry is called 'Bollywood', The Kannada Film Industry is hence called 'Sandalwood'. So we've always been there. U just failed to recognize the 4th largest film industry in India 🙄🙄

So called North Indians can’t step out of their own cities and find a good place to live in their own state and lives up with a superiority complex that they are something much above the southerners.. while in reality the south is at least 20 years more developed on a macro basis than the north..we have far better living conditions even in the most rural regions than a normal village in the north. 
The whole point is that if you north people want to pick up an argument or make jokes about south please be prepared with the statistics.

North India ( especially hindi speaking region ) : Tamils hate us.

North east : Tamils don't help , you know

Entire south exept Kerala and TN : Tamils think they are above us. They are so arrogant.

Malayalies : we love tamil. No much hatred 

Tamils : 🤔 what the heck is happening here. 
1. We didn't neglect or oppose hindi , we just say don't make it compulsory. Why you're thinking Tamils are against Hindi and hindi speaking ppl ?

2.didnt expected this. Pls come to TN and see how tamil hospitality is. Best in India.

3. That's so heartbreaking. Issues like kaveri was political reasons. Fighting Chennai vs Bangalore and Hyderabad was just competition. Why much hatred. Also we love our tamil and it's the oldest language. So we are proud of it. What's wrong with it ?? Where is the arrogance you can see here ????

4. Tamils too love malayalies. It's not for the reason that malayalies love Tamils , it's a history made good relationship. 

Conclusion : we Tamils are proud of our language but it doesn't mean we hate other ethnic people in India. Also Tamils don't hate Hindi , telungu and kannada ppl. Those controversies are mad by the great great politicians.it doesn't resembles the ppl of TN. So , we love other languages too also we are proud of tamil and India. Don't spread hatred towards Tamils. Tamils want a good relationship and it actually makes India proud. Nanri 👍.",1,2,5,Tamil Nadu

Come on please read official languages act of 1963 and educate yourself that India doesn't have a national language.

Meaning union government has to communicate with Tamilnadu government in Tamil which those buggers have never honored.",1,1,4,Tamil Nadu
"I am North indian and I can say people here more illiterate than  south ones. 
The biggest proves is our movies. If you see any hit movie in bollywood there's 80%  chance you're going to get disappointed because we really don't care about story and plots but the actors and songs. 
(After Sushant's trajic death it is changing. P. S. - This man really changed the country)
But if you see Tollywood hit movies they're really really good and have lesser chance of disappointment. 
Bollywood used to be great but nowadays it is evolving backwards. 
But Tollywood is just acing it all.

"Things Kannadigas are tired of hearing:
1) Kannad Gothilla.. Hey its Kannad not Kannada. We always right it that way.
Our reaction: Just because u right it that way, don't snt change the name of my language, u ass.. Its Kannada... Like its not Hind and its Hindi, its not Kannad its Kannada...
2) There are too many people who have come into Bengaluru and spoilt the city. We Bengalurians should do something about this. 
Kannadigas: How long have u been in Bengaluru?
Non Kannadigas: 2 Years now..
Kannadigas be like: Shit the fuck up and leave.. 
3) Why do we need to know Kannad.? Kannada people can speak so many LANGUAGES. And what's with the culture. Hahahha
Kannadigas: You ass, we learnt ur language to respect u guys and to make u feel at home. We welcomed u with open arms to respect u and ur culture and ur disrespecting our culture. Buzz off dickhead. 
4) Kannadigas do not accept others, they're not open minded. And Bengaluru and ur state KA has developed because of us. 
Kannadigas: Ass.. Its because Kannadigas are open minded that Bengaluru today is a metropolitan city. Its because they allowed other cultures to come in that non Kannadigas are in a 49.5 perc population in Bengaluru and are all living in harmony and peace today. 
B'luru was always the home to IISC, Public sectors like BEL, HAL, BEML, BHEL and so on. It was always called the Garden city for its beautiful parks. It was the safest city in the 
country and the last city in the list of crime rates (before the IT revolution). Bengaluru's contribution to India in cricket, science, arts, music is enormous. Bengaluru musician Ricky Kej won Grammy for India. Wipro is a Karnataka company. The company that brought the new breeze of IT was Infosys. Padmabhushan Dr.
Narayana Murthy & Kannada writer Padmashri Dr.Sudha Murthy are proud Kannadigas. Founder of Cafe Coffee day across India Mr Siddhartha is a Kannadiga. MTR is a Karnataka company 
by a Kannadiga. Ours was the best city before IT revolution. It continues to be even after non locals started coming to the city. We aren't insecure nor are we dependent on anyone. 
Bengaluru has contributed not only to itself but also a lot to the whole nation. All the great guns in major fields have people from Karnataka. The person whose birthday we celebrate as Engineer's day in India, Bharatha Rathna Sir M Vishweshraiah was from K'nataka. Bhimsen Joshi was from Karnataka. By your logic why are your states still under developed? Why didn't you develop your city?
Non Kannadigas: NO reply
5) I didn't know Kannada film industry makes good films. I watched KGF and loved it.
Kannadigas: Know facts and do ur researches first u idiots. Kannada industry is an industry that started many 'firsts' in Indian Cinema. first underwater film of Indian cinema - Kannada(ondhu mutthina kathe).. first bond movie of Indian cinema - kannada(jedara bale) first south film to be shot outside India- kannada(africadalli sheela).. first actor from India to win doctorate- kannada(Dr Rajkumar sir ) only Indian actor to win prestigious kentucky colonel award which was earlier awarded to the British and Russian prime ministers only-kannada(Dr rajkumar Sir).the first a South Indian film to collect 65cr (Mungaru Male) with budget of 75lakh...The first slow motion song in India - Dr Vishnuvardhan Sir's Baare Baare from Kannada film Nagarahavu. The first Director to bring an international award for a nationwide popular TV series Malgudi Days (A proud Kannada superstar and director Shankarnag Sir). The only Indian Film to win more than 45 international awards with Hollywood director Francis Koppola (of a godfather fame) talking about the film: THITHI (Kannada).... Ravichandrans premaloka in late 80s and Dr Vishnuvardhan Sir's Cult classic Muthina Haara in early 80s were made with a budget of 1.75 crore each. Premaloka became a huge massive hit collecting that huge amount even in 80's where even bollywood weren't producing films in that budget. Manirathnam, balumahendra got a break from Kannada films. Kannada FILM Industry is located in the South Indian state of Karnataka, the state that grows highest Sandalwood in India. Like Hindi Film Industry is called 'Bollywood', The Kannada Film Industry is hence called 'Sandalwood'. So we've always been there. U just failed to recognize the 4th largest film industry in India 🙄🙄
Non Kannadigas: NO reply
6) You know how we celebrate Dussera? You won't even imagine
Kannadigas be like: Have u ever heard of the world famous Mysuru Dasara? People come from across the world to see Dusara here 🙄
They're like: Really?
7) MTR DOSAS, Mysur Pak, Filter Coffees, Coorg are all overrated.
Kannadigas be like: Just Fuck off u donkey that cannot differentiate between the actual Sandalwood and plywood 😂
8) Bengaluru traffic has become worst now. 
Kannadigas : Yeah exactly, after people like u have come in 😣😣
9) Hey I  have no problem with Madrasis.. 
Kannadigas: Who the fuck told u Kannadigas are Madrasis? Who the hell was ur Geography teacher in school?
10) After listening to the epic Kannada songs like Jotheyali Jothe Jotheyali, Kanasalu Neene and Ondanondu Kaaladalli Aarambha and saying that the Hindi versions are better than Kannada Versions (after shamelessly copying it without crediting the music director for 2 of these songs) 😂

These peoples belongs to original father and mother group
Means ek baap ki aulad
These peoples only Belongs to a very Higher caste in Rajasthan
Another one is marwadi means full rich family basically these peoples not belongs ek baap ki aulad means they all belong Rand ki aulad these people not born through real father and mother they all belongs lamadis ki rakhel ki aulad

Kanjoosi to khair hai negetive thing no doubt about it but yes those community who r good with finance is called kanjoos like in muslim Bohra community is our marwari in general term but as I have bohra friend and being with him i understand thier concept of money handling what I understand is these community don't like wasting thing up no matter what and that's sometime make them look like kanjoos creepy business mind but what is a negetive thing they have it if u ask me is they could became really mean in business and i guess that's where u find them kanjoos they literally could eat up ur profit margin as well if they get the chance they have no mercy in business neither they tolerate any short coming these communities is really good business is thier strong side and they never hesitate use their strong aide to crush u they always support thier community no matter what just discuss ur best idea with them and u will find out they doing work on it right away and one more thing importantly they will never gave thier daughter to u no matter what even if u r same religion for them community is everything that's is what I learn being with them and i feel my Sindhi friend is almost same with my bohra friend in term of business mind,1,1,2,Rajasthan

"The marwadis spend lavishly on activities in which they feel gratification. They spend rationally and even spend once in a year heavily. Their spendings reflects in their cultural habits. But the drawback which I have observed that they prejudge other professions and few marwaris don't pay well to their staffs thats why they often face high attrition rate or labour turnover. Marwadies are less in academia but more in business. Yes, they have transformed geographically the area around them but like every community in India which have some drawbacks they are quite judgemental to other profession where position and education matters but not paid well. Punjabis, Mallus, Tamil, Biharis, Marathis, Gujaratis etc all have some pros and cons but when it start affecting others conflict happens and streotypes sustains.",1,1,3,Rajasthan

"Marwaris are kanjoos. And being kanjoos is indeed a bad thing. I am explaining why.. Because when they trade, they're not transparent. They only think about their own profit. No emotional connect with their customer. Sometimes they don't even want to adapt to the needs of the customer. And when you see it everywhere, you tend to hate the community. This is the real reason.
Gujaratis, jains or sindhis are also money minded, but they don't do kanjoosi with the quality of the product. That's why they're not labeled as kanjoos!!",1,2,3,Rajasthan

"I have worked under Marwaris twice in my career. Also, know few Marwaris personally. It is true they're very hardworking but from my personal experience I would say that they're indeed 'Kanjoos' when it comes to paying money to their employees or for any work. 
In my last company my Marwari boss gave us only 5% after two years. They consider all employees like their driver or maid. They don't regard the education and effort for a job, hence don't value it much. They even don't respect the age...calls 'Tum' to someone who is older but expects them to address them as 'Sir'. They make their employees to work constantly yet they don't pay them well. I was not happy with the raise and told the same to the boss. Left the company after two months.
Spending lavishly on weddings and religious events are to boost their ego and a way to show-off their wealth.",1,1,2,Rajasthan

"If one understood the real factors that had led to the partition, one would not have posed such a hypothetical question. The nation witnessed 3 separatist agitations on Teluguland since my birth.
1.	The Telugu politicians are the worst pack in India. Others may resort to corruption and violence too. But our leaders are distinct in that they resort to an extremely narrow version of regionalism in addition to the above. They may rest for a few years with their mouths shut. But there is no guarantee that they won’t rake it up gain. So the Telugu unity always teetered precariously on a fragile ground. Our leaders won’t allow any semblance of it. If not in 2014, partition will happen in 2024 or 2034. You never know. In fact, right now, AP is sitting on another regional time-bomb.
2.	Because it is very easy to divide the Telugus, caste-wise, district-wise, region-wise. You name it, you can divide them that way. It is so easy, easier than drinking a glass of water. Easy to accomplish for everyone on the earth. It is enough if you just throw the stone of a nasty debate on something like the greatness of a caste, or the meanness of a caste, the villainy of a region, the backwardness of another region. Praise a dialect or insult another. Immediately tempers run high and you will find the Telugus in an unstoppable mutual assassination mood.",1,2,5,Telangana

world famous oscar winning film director-  Bengali, some of best scientists and mathematicians, poets- bengali.
Honestly speaking at that time Bengalies were really great , they had a great culture and were all-rounder.Bengalis history is very bright and remarkable. But now Bengali lost Bengalism a lot, but still we are trying to bring it back a little bit.

You can say Bengalies are Knowledgeable.Yeah Dont know about intellectualism but they are way more knowledgeable.Bcs they have an all time craving for gaining knowledge from everywhere literally.And next day it becomes a topic of discussion in their friend's group.

"to all the bengali hindu brothers , i need to convey a message all this good videos are made to get views from bengali community but in reality what are the stereotypes i am saying.
1. Bengali girls are beshya(""prostitute"") , easy to get laid .
2. Bengali boys are horny and they dont bath.
3. excessive politeness of bengali people are seen as a sign of weak people.
4. they think you are a bangladeshi because you speak in bengali.
Solutions to your problem are the following:-
- Help your community members only , dont do unnecessary charity.
- marry within your community(i.e bengali community).
- occupy positions of power.
- Dont be too good of a bhadrolok, rather be assertive.
- practise your culture openly(i.e shakti worship)
- Never compromise.
- Have kids ( tfr of bengali hindu -1.6 which is below replacement level, your culture will get vanished otherwise).",1,3,3,West Bengal

"Not one, so many best things are there about being bengali.

1.First of all , the language in which we speak is considered to be the sweetest among all.

2. A bengali simply knows two things...FOOD and ADDA.

we have so many combinations of food for different seasons and weather...for example...rainy days are incomplete without khichuri and iliish(hilsha) vaja, winter is incomplete without various types of pithas. If i continue to give the list of delicious foods, the answer will be never ending one.

3. Another one is ""বারো মাসে তেরো পার্বন্"" . There are so many pujas and parbans that bengalis never get bored from their daily lives.

4. Bengali literature is so vast and rich. Being a bengali. you get to know Rabindranath Tagore's poems, stories, songs. Besides Satyajit Ray, Sukumar Ray, Sunil Ganguly, Buddhadeb Guha have wrote so many good books.

5. Okay. I forgot another best point. Basically bengalis are lazy, so they want a work to be done with minimum effort, thus bengalis are intelligent!

Now, it is a never ending list seriously.

finally, bengalis are the only race, who fought for their mother tongue and died for the same.

North east indians can atleast proudly claim their asian ethnicity. Many indians r even not called asians by many foreigners even though we live in asia. Ppl of many parts of india...especially north r thought to be foreign invaders in india(aryan invasion). I mean common how can ppl so proudly bully north east Indians of not being indian....we r no more indians and they r no less indians. I even have met north easterns who have sharp features. So next time don't judge ppl so easily. Next time if u see ppl having more of typical asian features..don't assume that they r foreigners...u shud remember that india is in asia...so typical asian features maybe common. Just ask them which part of india they r from even if u never visited north east.. this will give them also happiness that other states acknowledge them... if they r not indians they will specify...just have the basic knowledge that north east indians look a little different than us but they look much more asian than us so how can we bully them i never understood...our forefathers as well as their forefathers lived in india. Next time if u make fun of ne...u r making a bigger fun of urself by showing ur lack of even 5th grade level education. If ne ppl get bullied infront of me...i will always raise voice and support them. And i ask north eastern ppl to just ask the ppl who bully u if they failed in fifth grade. I know north east ppl r so kind that they wont bully visitors in their states otherwise i wud have asked them to ask indians if they r Pakistani if they call u chini.😅

"All the comments are mostly from Northeasterners or NE sympathisers and those who never visited NE states but blindly fall into the emotional narrative when they see PM Modi in the Assamese towel.

Let me tell you how it feels like to live in North East, the so called 'pride of India' !!!

The states of Meghalaya, Nagaland, Mizoram, etc. are the only ones where you (non-mongoloid) can't even dare to buy an 'inch' of land, for any transfer of land from a Mongoloid person to you is forbidden by the law of these states.

As a mainland Indian (non-tribal), You can't carry out any good business in cities like Shillong or Kohima. Issuance of Business permits are restricted to mongoloid citizens only. Instances, when local non-tribal businessmen were harrassed, lynched, burnt down alive are way too many.

As a non-mongoloid (Aryan or Dravidian), You can't marry any Khasi girl in Shillong, for its a law that if she marries you, she will lose her 'Tribal' status and your Children won't be considered 'indigenous' or 'Son of the soil' and will be barred from all government facilities. In short, your Children will be considered racial 'abominition'. And such a law is also being promulgated to be passed in the Arunachal Pradesh assembly to dissuade mongoloid girls from marrying you.

Biharis, Marwaris, Bengalis are denied state government jobs in Assam. Until 2010, celebrating independence day was banned in Assam by extremists and the local Assamese population supported that, not out of fear of the militants, but because of the emotional sympathy they had for the 'noble' cause of seccession from India which these militants were fighting for.

I can tell you many more.... the great history of attrocities the mongoloids have committed upon the mainland Indians (Marwari, Bihari, Bengali, Nepali, etc.)... but it's a long list.

The love of the Northeasterners for India is as long as article 371, ILP permit and ST quota exists. The day the Goverment of India decides to scrap these three for proper integration of the country, the country would see the true colour of some people from the 'pride of India'.",1,3,4,Northeast-India

Here you can see different people from different cultures and communities living and befriending with each other like family (mostly Bengali and Nepalese, they are like brothers and sisters living together in this city). This is the place that joins north-east with other parts of India, that's why Siliguri is known as ""Gateway to the North-east India"". Proud to be from here. 🙏",1,2,2,Northeast-India
"I have lived in the north east for 16 years and let me tell you for sure there is more racism in North East India for non tribals and in organised way and through local governments support.

But nobody brings out the truth as to how tribals treat non tribals in Northeast ,if I am not mistaken thousands of innocent non tribals has faced and are still facing harrasment ,murder back there but nobody reports it
All they just say nido Tanya was killed
During ILP movement hundreds of innocent non tribals we're killed but the entire nation was quite as no news passes out from the region 
ek hath se tali nahi bajti

Non tribals who are born in North East are denied rations.denied jobs ,denied land ,denied govt facilities.
I have been a victim myself 
So called systematic racism that goes on in Northeast for being a non tribal.",1,2,3,Northeast-India

Hamare pass khane ke liye ek roti bhi hogi par agar koi bhukha aa jaye toh hum unhe nirass nahi bhejte yah up ke rahne waalo.... pure desh ko hamne pehle bhi bacchaya hai aab bhi bachayenge... 

Aaj ka Delhi aur others state itihas me tutkar bane hai,desh ki mitti se gaddari hamari khoon me nahi(aiesa koi aur Pradesh hai toh batao Bihar ko chodkar kyuki UP aur Bihar ek nasal ke log hai isliye),Jis logo ko gamand hai aapne koi kitne bhi bade  Veer hone ka,puri biradari ko le aayo wada hai aapnko UP me Baapo ke bhi Baap milenge aathat Asli Yodha...

2.Felt a bit of RSM and others improvisation bro. May be becz of Usage of Dude on every sentence at the beginning and usage of Man at every end of the sentence. Don't use them bro..Bring your own unique words.. i know they r common words,but, style of usage also similar. Stop watching RSM or bring ur own style of dailogue delivery.
3. There were tons of commedians in youtube who use uncomfortable language to crete a joke. People may laugh at that moment, But it neither create long-lasting  impression nor repetitive watch.

4. Be confident brother..Why long pasues after every line.. Give a small pause, if people really laughs, pause will come automatically. Long pauses forces audience to laugh and impress you.😅

"you will get to taste the most authentic hyderabadi biryani in the old city households of hyderabad. that is what is called bawarchii khaana. Being a member of hyderabad foodies group, I understand that there are a lot of mixed reviews on biryani from shah ghouse, shadab, paradise, cafe bahar etc... From my experience, the most delicious biryani I ate was in bawarchi biryani, rtc x roads. The place is always packed because of 2 factors, quality and affordability. Most people dont understand the real meaning of bawarchi - which means a chef. So, the whole Veg biryani is not a biryani concept is wrong. It was explained by my friend's mom, that there are a certain sects of muslims, who prefer to cook only rice mixed with vegetables, while savoring the juicy chicken / mutton / meat separately that helps them enjoy the delicacy while fulfilling the hunger. All hail bawarchi khaana and biryani.

"If one understood the real factors that had led to the partition, one would not have posed such a hypothetical question. The nation witnessed 3 separatist agitations on Teluguland since my birth.
1.	The Telugu politicians are the worst pack in India. Others may resort to corruption and violence too. But our leaders are distinct in that they resort to an extremely narrow version of regionalism in addition to the above. They may rest for a few years with their mouths shut. But there is no guarantee that they won’t rake it up gain. So the Telugu unity always teetered precariously on a fragile ground. Our leaders won’t allow any semblance of it. If not in 2014, partition will happen in 2024 or 2034. You never know. In fact, right now, AP is sitting on another regional time-bomb.
2.	Because it is very easy to divide the Telugus, caste-wise, district-wise, region-wise. You name it, you can divide them that way. It is so easy, easier than drinking a glass of water. Easy to accomplish for everyone on the earth. It is enough if you just throw the stone of a nasty debate on something like the greatness of a caste, or the meanness of a caste, the villainy of a region, the backwardness of another region. Praise a dialect or insult another. Immediately tempers run high and you will find the Telugus in an unstoppable mutual assassination mood.",1,2,2,Telangana

"1000 of years ago hen there were jungles in North India.. it were the farming community the JAATS who cleared the forests, tilled the land, got rid of the wild animals, made the land productive, fed the society
It were the BRAHMINS that provided a social order, where governance was based on religion as the modern notions of present day statehood/constitution were not there to govern the rustic tribal population.
It were the KSHATRIYA community that was given the task of governing the society. They were the face, the seal under which everyone united.
It were the GUJJARS who domesticated cows and provided milk, the DALITS/SHUDRAS who did all the menial work which people hesitated or were scared to do. KHATIS (Carpenters), LOHARS(metal smiths), SAINIS (Gardners), BANIAS (Traders)
Many other communities provided for in the society.
 Becasue there were no educational institutes, the skills, knowledge of each profession was family based and transferred from word of mouth. Everyone did what they did the best. Everyone was specialised in their field of work.

But now we are in the 21st century. Modern systems have come up. Our ancient ways of social order are now redundant and useless. Now everyone is free to follow whatever they feel to do like.

I am also a JAAT from HARYANA and my family left farming 2 generations ago. 

People should be proud of their roots. Their ancestors who worked hard in whatever profession they were in. But with time they should move on. We are in modern society and should work hard to make our country a global power. 

Politicians try to create divide in the society to earn their bread and butter. One should not fall pray to such cheap tactics... 
This guy Rajkumar Saini, BJP MP has emerged as ANTi JAAT leader.. but one should as who knew him before he started anti jaat politics. He was nothing. No one knew him. His inflamatory speeches against jaat community led to riots. But he became famous.

Same goes for YASHPAL MALIK who wants to become JAAT leader. No one knew him before this. He is not even from Haryana but from Western UP. While Hardik patel was give no entry notice and FIR filed against in gujarat. Yashpal malik is still scot free and have no cases against him. He also incites jats on many occasion on reservation demand. But the current BJP state government has given him a free hand to do so.

Now I will come to BJP politics. They talk about Hindutva but they are the ones who divide the Hindus for their cheap electoral gains. There politics is of uniting people against the majority/dominating community in the state. Be it Patils in Gujarat, Marathas in Maharashtra, Yadavs in UP& BIhar.
I am no fan of Congress as they are corrupt looters who literally raped India in the last 60 years but just want to aware people that be aware of the hidden agenda behind everyone.

- Akshay kumar makes the most nationalistic movies but he has canadian citizenship.

- Trump has been shown as a fool who is taking USA out of international treaties like paris agreement, UNESCO etc. On paper it is shown Trumps foolishness but in reality it is USA which is taking a step back as the world is becoming a Multi power dominated areana with the rise of India, China, resurgance of Russia etc. They have no other option but in the name of Trump (who is just a face) and use him to back off alliances and treaties which cannot be maintained in such an atmosphere.

- Demonatization was shown to tackle black money. But the real reason for it was financial inclusion and make the country a more formal economy. This was neccesary before due to NPA crisis as banks were running dry of cash and millions of people indirectly supported banks by depositing cash.

- Karan Johar & Kapor team and Khan team have dominated Bollywood for years. They have cheated their fans by throwing whatever shit they want. Because people had no option but to watch their shit. Nepotism is most prevalent in bollywood. But this was before internet.. Now with netflix, youtube people have so many choices.

Be an aware citizen. Make educated choices. Dont fall for other peoples trap. Be it any field.
