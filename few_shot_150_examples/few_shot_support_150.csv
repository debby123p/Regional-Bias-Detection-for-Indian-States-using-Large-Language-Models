in general most people from other states think were extremely rude backwards etc due to stereotypes from media and general misconceptions people who arent from our northwestern region even group us together with bihar up etc lol pahadis in particular just have bad experiences with unruly tourists combine this with our general negative reputation and they start to hate us i think its somewhat valid tbh people from haryana punjab etc are generally kind of loud and rowdy pahadi culture is the exact opposite from ours so it is probably kind of jarring when they get a ton of tourists from our area other states hate us for no real reason to be completely honest i wouldnt worry about that too much,1,2,1,Uttarakhand

what are you some kind of delusional dumbfuck language isnt a major concern in karnatakaesp in bangalore hindi imposition is a major issue only in tn and weve seen the result there in karnataka it was mainly hatefrom muslims women being forced to not wear their hijab to colleges or muslim workers being kicked out of covid warroom by the uneducated tejasvi surya same moron who opened the airplane emergency hatch creating communal disharmony rape cases like that prajawal guy etc there are minor language beefs amongst people but it has never escalated to a major issue unlike the uneducated north most southies speak multiple languages all the increased aggression in bangalore is mainly coz of bjp and them playing the communal card language is not even close to being a major issue here,1,1,1,South-India

now i realize you have been very active in this thread probably you dont have nothing better to do than taking help from chatgpt to answer to everyones questionslet me enlighten you kidi have been working with ngo in jharkhand since last 4 years and therefore i know the problems faced by the marginalised here since you used this phrase i know the problems faced by them and how they are fed up by the corrupt govt practices existing in this state and on top of that the freebies that are being promised by the current govt will lead to more debt for the state and that is why i am calling this a state of fools i am also a part of it because currently i am doing something for the betterment of the locals here atleast i am trying but since you are more interested in debating with redditors with answers created by chatgpti would only say one thing to yougo get a life,1,2,1,Jharkhand
some aspects of the culture are pretty violent and pretty misogynistic its hypermasculine but i dont feel as if its thats as relevant today my cousins in india are landowning jatts in punjab itself and are among the most tame people i know i feel as if most jatts in modern times just flaunt it on their insta and twitter profiles and arent actually violent and such some of the greatest intellectuals in punjab were jatts as well so one cant always generalize it is a much different culture than typical desis that ill give but i always believe as one of my core ideals that you treat people as individuals culture is generalization but each persons worldview will ultimately be unique and its worth getting to know that individual over generalizing its something i realized after i had a prejudice against south and north indians for ridiculing me a lot in middle school but made a lot of friends from those demographics in high school that were awesome people,1,3,2,"Haryana, Punjab"

"One if the leading problem in MP is the corruption, there is too much corruption going on. People even know how much bride the police take when they stop you at signal for something. (It's 200 btw in Indore). Apart from this, roads of the state are in heavoc. Even in the top city of MP which is Indore (not Bhopal even though it's the capital), the roads are like village roads, cracks and potholes, even the newly constructed roads are like that. So roads are definitely a problem but the MP govt approves a lot of funds on roads, which the corrupt people automatically consume. IT sector can actually boom in MP, especially in Indore as it is developing at a very fast pace and the quality of life here is also peaceful compared to other big cities so yeah it's a thing which can be worked on. IDA should allot a lot more land to big IT companies at low price so they can setup more of there offices in the state. MP has a lot of tourist places, but they are not properly maintained and promoted like they do in Rajasthan. It should be done here too. Gwalior and the regions near it have forts and palaces. Sanchi stupa is here as well which is an international historical site and than there's also wild life sanctuaries but they aren't promoted which is a shame. MP can become the tourist capital of India even if not the industrial capital. One thing is MP should revive it's clothing mills which used to biggest in the country at one point. So yeah, MP should focus more on IT industries, tourism, better road connectivity to other big and small cities and lastly on making skilled labourers.",1,2,3,Madhya Pradesh

im from bangalore and i do have to acknowledge that we do have a certain level of animosity towards people from the north but nothing specific to a state to be honest a lot of it is some racist bs yes but its a two way street i have seen folks from the north act rowdy spit paan everywhere abuse me in hindi and act entitled but on the other end my business partner is from the north so are quite a few of my friends from my point of view i think that region has been screwed over by shoddy government and social work that kind of trickles down into how some parts of society acts and behaves overpopulation mannerisms the treatment of women these are areas that needs to be worked on but none of this should happen as generalized racism not every person from up or bihar is like that same way not everyone from the south is like that we need to act more responsibly,0,0,0,

if you carry so much pride with your north indian region call all your cheap labour back there and leave us alone we dont want to associate us with idiots like you remember the food you are eating is because of us cos you guys dont know how to survive and so we are subsidizing for you on top of that you are flooding our places with illiterates something is culturally wrong how about stop breeding like rabbits and figuring out what is going on there sounds wise maybe not looking at your kiddish mentality,1,3,2,North-India

you just echoed not a panindian but an universal fact one guy had told me openly that they cannot stand the liberal artsy and cosmopolitan nature of bengalis those were his words a gurjar haryanvi its just inferiority complex stemming from their own regressive culture that most of them come from needless to say the guy had a bloody nose after that and i was given a warning by the local cops,0,0,0,

changed their name to blend in this i feel is partially true i feel that many mallu parents name their kids english christian names instead of malayalam christian names because they want their kids to fit in the immigrant generation doesnt change their names but they do give their kids white names a lot of the english christian names have malayalam translations for example joseph is ousep matthew is matthai george is varghese isaac is eesaac etc all of my ancestors had mallu christian names but starting with my grandads generation people started giving their kids english christian names but christianity has strong roots in the mallu community the syriac christian community which i am a part of is one of the oldest christian communities in the world most of us didnt convert to christianity to fit in in america like bobby jindal or nikki haley,1,2,1,Kerala
